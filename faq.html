            <p class="large">Why should I use GBM over another backup solution?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM was developed to be a simple to use, but powerful if you need it to be.  It's a "set it and forget it" backup solution.<br />
              <br />
              For detailed feature information and system requirements check the <a href="about.html">About</a> section.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why would I use this for Steam, Origin or GOG games when the client already has cloud backups?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sure other clients have cloud saving, but they're built strictly for convenience and give the user very little control over them.  GBM is also convenient, but gives you much more control over your backups if you want it.<br />
              <br />
              The biggest benefit of using GBM is that it compresses your save files, some games have extremely large save files that can be compressed to a mere fraction of their original size.  Most clients do not compress your saved games before uploading, wasting your bandwidth and slowing down your connection with large and lengthy uploads.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Is GBM safe to use and does it respect my privacy?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM does not perform any operation without request and consent until the user sets it up that way.<br />
              <br />
              GBM only connects to the internet to import game configuration data at the user's request. No information from your computer is ever uploaded to the internet by GBM.<br />
              <br />
              If you're really paranoid you can look at the source code available with each release.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">How is GBM a cloud solution if it never uploads anything to the internet?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM is only a cloud solution if you want it to be. GBM needs to be paired with a cloud service that provides a folder sync client, such as OneDrive or Dropbox, to be a true cloud solution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why isn't GBM directly intergrated with a cloud service?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM was designed with freedom of choice in mind, this way you can choose whatever solution you want.<br />
              <br />
              Do you want backup and share via any cloud service? You can.<br />
              Do you want to backup and share via a USB drive? You can.<br />
              Do you want to backup and share via a network share? You can.<br />
              <br />
              You can also use GBM on a single computer if you like!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">The Game Manager looks super complicated, I thought this was supposed to be easy!?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Game Manager might look scary, but the basic functions are pretty self-explanatory and most fields can be ignored. There is a <a href="manual.html">manual</a> available that helps explain features in more detail.<br />
              <br />
              There's already a large amount of preconfigured games available from the <a href="GBM_Official.xml">official list</a> and an "Add Game Wizard" is provided to help novice users setup their own games in GBM.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">The <a href="GBM_Official.xml">official game list</a> isn't updated very often and why aren't my games already configured?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Installing, configuring and testing games with GBM requires a lot of time. Not to mention a copy of every game is required to do this properly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Will GBM be avaliable for Linux or MacOS?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>As of v0.96 or higher GBM will run in <a href="linux.html">Linux using Mono</a>. MacOS has not been tested, technically it "should" work with Mono as well.</li>
              <li>GBM also runs in <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> with very limited usefulness. Check out the <a href="wine.html">Wine FAQ</a> for details.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Will GBM be avaliable in other languages?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There are no plans to support other languages at this time. However, as of v0.95 GBM can be easily translated. Check out the <a href="translations.html">Translation FAQ</a> if you're interested.</li>
