            <p class="large">Why should I use GBM over another backup solution?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM was developed to be a very simple but powerful "set it and forget it" backup solution. If other backup solutions seem too complicated, try this one!<br />
              <br />
              For detailed feature information and system requirements check the <a href="about.html">About</a> section.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">I don't like unfinished beta software, should I wait until the final version of GBM?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM may still be in a beta phase, but it is feature complete, reliable and safe to use. You can read about any <a href="https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/issues">known issues</a> before downloading.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Is GBM safe to use and does it respect my privacy?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM does not perform any operation without request and consent until the user sets it up that way.<br />
              <br />
              GBM only connects to the internet to import game configuration data at the user's request. No information from your computer is ever uploaded to the internet by GBM.<br />
              <br />
              If you're really paranoid you can look at the source code available with each release.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">How is GBM a cloud solution if it never uploads anything to the internet?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM is only a cloud solution if you want it to be. GBM needs to be paired with a cloud service that provides a folder sync client, such as OneDrive or Dropbox, to be a true cloud solution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why isn't GBM directly intergrated with a cloud service?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There was no point in doing so, GBM was designed with freedom of choice in mind.<br />
              <br />
              Do you want backup and share via a cloud? You can.<br />
              Do you want to backup and share via a USB drive? You can.<br />
              Do you want to backup and share via a network share? You can.<br />
              <br />
              You can also use GBM on a single computer if you like!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">The Game Manager looks complicated, I thought this was supposed to be easy!?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Game Manager might look a little scary, but the basic functions are pretty self-explanatory. There is a <a href="manual.html">manual</a> available that helps explain features in more detail.<br />
              <br />
              There's already a large amount of preconfigured games available from the <a href="GBM_Official.xml">official list</a> and an "Add Game Wizard" is provided to help novice users setup their own games in GBM.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">The <a href="GBM_Official.xml">official game list</a> isn't updated very often and why aren't my games already configured?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM is currently a development team of 1. Installing, configuring and testing games with GBM requires a lot of time. Not to mention a copy of every game is required to do this properly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Will GBM be avaliable for Linux or MacOS?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>As of v0.96 GBM will run in <a href="linux.html">Linux using Mono</a>. MacOS has not been tested.</li>
              <li>GBM also runs in <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> with limited usefulness. Check out the <a href="wine.html">Wine FAQ</a> for details.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Will GBM be ported to .NET Core?</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core">.NET Core</a> will not support Windows Forms, so the entire UI would have to be redone. I'm interested in doing this, but I can't commit to it at this time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Will GBM be avaliable in other languages?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There are no plans to support other languages at this time. However, as of v0.95 GBM can be easily translated. Check out the <a href="translations.html">Translation FAQ</a> if you're interested.</li>
