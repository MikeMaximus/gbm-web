            <p class="large">Why should I use GBM over another backup solution?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM was developed to be a very simple but powerful "set it and forget it" backup solution. If other backup solutions seem too complicated, try this one!<br />
              <br />
              For detailed feature information and system requirements check the <a href="about.html">About</a> section.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why would I use this for Steam and Origin games when the client already has cloud backups?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Steam, Origin and other clients have cloud saving, but it's built strictly for convenience and gives the user very little control.  GBM is also convenient, but gives you much more control over your backups if you want it.<br />
              <br />
              For detailed feature information and system requirements check the <a href="about.html">About</a> section.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">I don't like unfinished beta software, should I wait until the final version of GBM?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM may still be in a beta phase, but it is feature complete, reliable and safe to use. You can read about any <a href="https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/issues">known issues</a> before downloading.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Is GBM safe to use and does it respect my privacy?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM does not perform any operation without request and consent until the user sets it up that way.<br />
              <br />
              GBM only connects to the internet to import game configuration data at the user's request. No information from your computer is ever uploaded to the internet by GBM.<br />
              <br />
              If you're really paranoid you can look at the source code available with each release.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">How is GBM a cloud solution if it never uploads anything to the internet?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM is only a cloud solution if you want it to be. GBM needs to be paired with a cloud service that provides a folder sync client, such as OneDrive or Dropbox, to be a true cloud solution.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why isn't GBM directly intergrated with a cloud service?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There was no point in doing so, GBM was designed with freedom of choice in mind.<br />
              <br />
              Do you want backup and share via a cloud? You can.<br />
              Do you want to backup and share via a USB drive? You can.<br />
              Do you want to backup and share via a network share? You can.<br />
              <br />
              You can also use GBM on a single computer if you like!</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">The Game Manager looks complicated, I thought this was supposed to be easy!?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Game Manager might look a little scary, but the basic functions are pretty self-explanatory. There is a <a href="manual.html">manual</a> available that helps explain features in more detail.<br />
              <br />
              There's already a large amount of preconfigured games available from the <a href="GBM_Official.xml">official list</a> and an "Add Game Wizard" is provided to help novice users setup their own games in GBM.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">The <a href="GBM_Official.xml">official game list</a> isn't updated very often and why aren't my games already configured?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM is currently a development team of 1. Installing, configuring and testing games with GBM requires a lot of time. Not to mention a copy of every game is required to do this properly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Will GBM be avaliable for Linux or MacOS?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>As of v0.96 GBM will run in <a href="linux.html">Linux using Mono</a>. MacOS has not been tested.</li>
              <li>GBM also runs in <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> with limited usefulness. Check out the <a href="wine.html">Wine FAQ</a> for details.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Will GBM be ported to .NET Core?</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core">.NET Core</a> will not support Windows Forms, so the entire UI would have to be redone. I'm interested in doing this, but I can't commit to it at this time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Will GBM be avaliable in other languages?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>There are no plans to support other languages at this time. However, as of v0.95 GBM can be easily translated. Check out the <a href="translations.html">Translation FAQ</a> if you're interested.</li>
