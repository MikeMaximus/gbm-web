                <p class="large">Why should I use GBM over another backup solution?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GBM was developed to be a very simple but powerful "set it and forget it" backup solution.  If other backup solutions seem too complicated, try this one!<br /><br />For detailed feature information and system requirements check the <a href="about.php">About</a> section.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="large">I don't like unfinished beta software, should I wait until the final version of GBM?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GBM may still be in a beta phase, but it is feature complete, reliable and safe to use.  You can read about any <a href="https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/issues">known issues</a> before downloading.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="large">Is GBM safe to use and does it respect my privacy?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GBM does not perform any operation without request and consent until the user sets it up that way.<br /><br />GBM only connects to the internet to import game configuration data at the user's request.  No information from your computer is ever uploaded to the internet by GBM.<br /><br />If you're really paranoid you can look at the source code available with each release.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="large">How is GBM a cloud solution if it never uploads anything to the internet?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GBM is only a cloud solution if you want it to be.  GBM needs to be paired with a cloud service that provides a folder sync client, such as OneDrive or Dropbox, to be a true cloud solution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="large">Why isn't GBM directly intergrated with a cloud service?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There was no point in doing so, GBM was designed with freedom of choice in mind.<br /><br />Do you want backup and share via a cloud?  You can.<br/>Do you want to backup and share via a USB drive?  You can.<br />Do you want to backup and share via a network share?  You can.<br /><br />You can also use GBM on a single computer if you like!</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="large">The Game Manager looks complicated, I thought this was supposed to be easy!?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Game Manager might look a little scary,  but the basic functions are pretty self-explanatory. There is a <a href="manual.php">manual</a> available that helps explain features in more detail.<br /><br />There's already around 150 preconfigured games available from the official list and an "Add Game Wizard" is provided to help novice users setup their own games in GBM.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="large">The official game list isn't updated very often and why aren't my games already configured?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GBM is currently a development team of 1.  Installing, configuring and testing games with GBM requires a lot of time.  Not to mention a copy of every game is required to do this properly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="large">Will GBM be avaliable for Linux or MacOS?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are no plans to support other platforms at this time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="large">Will GBM be avaliable in other languages?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are currently no plans for other languages.  As of the current version, translating GBM to another language would be a difficult process and require software development skills.  A future release will have better support for translations.</li>
