            <p class="large">Can I run GBM on Linux?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>As of v0.96, GBM will run on Linux using Mono. You can detect and backup saved games from Linux native games and games running in Wine.</li>
            </ul><img class="centered" src="images/screens/gbm_linux_native.jpg" width="611" height="443" alt="Native Example" /><br />
            <p class="large">What's required to run GBM on Linux?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM requires a few prerequisites to be installed. Many of these may be pre-installed on your distribution.
                <ul>
                  <li>Mono Framework with Visual Basic .NET and WinForms
                    <ul>
                      <li>The <b>mono-vbnc</b> package and it's dependencies should cover this on Debain based distros.</li>
                      <li>Visit <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">mono-project.com</a> for the best way to install this on your distro.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>SQLite3 library
                    <ul>
                      <li>The <b>libsqlite3-0</b> package on Debain based distros.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>7-Zip
                    <ul>
                      <li>The <b>p7zip-full</b> package on Debain based distros.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Bash - GNU Bourne Again SHell
                    <ul>
                      <li>The <b>bash</b> package on Debain based distros.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">How do I install and run GBM on Linux?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Download the latest package from <a href="https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/releases">Releases</a> and extract it to a folder. Navigate to the folder in a terminal and use the command <b>mono GBM.exe</b> to run it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Are there any limitations while running in Linux?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The tray icon does not function correctly in Linux and is disabled. You can minimize GBM to the task bar instead.</li>
	      <li>GBM can't automatically detect a game's icon, publisher, or version in Linux.  That information can be manually set in the Game Manager.</li>
              <li>You may encounter slight glitches with the interface, mostly when using listbox controls. These glitches are related to Mono and possibly your video driver/version. I've done my best to minimize the worst of these issues.</li>
              <li>GBM may not exit cleanly if a critical error occurs, the process will need to be killed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">How do I configure GBM to detect Wine games?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You don't need to do anything special. Simply set the game's "Process" field to it's Windows executable name (without the extension), exactly the same as configuring a game on Windows.</li>
              <li>Please note that while GBM displays games running as "wine-preloader" from the Wine folder, it still knows the game's actual working directory and will properly backup a relative path configuration.</li>
            </ul><img class="centered" src="images/screens/gbm_linux_wine.jpg" width="611" height="443" alt="Wine Example" /><br />
            <p class="large">Can GBM share the same backup folder between Linux and Windows?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Yes it can, you can play a game on Linux and have GBM restore your saved games to continue on Windows and vice versa.</li>
              <li>Linux and Windows will rarely ever share the same backup configurations. It's highly recommended to disable the "Sync game list data with backup folder" option in Settings, then use seperate configurations on each OS with matching names. This ensures you can share your saved games, but backup configurations will remain separate.</li>
            </ul><img class="centered" src="images/screens/gbm_linux_settings.jpg" width="450" height="540" alt="Settings Example" /><br />
            <p class="large">I'm getting an error message when I run GBM!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The following are some common errors and the reason:
                <ul>
                  <li>The entry point method could not be loaded.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This indicates that Mono Visual Basic or WinForms support is not installed.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>7-Zip was not found. The application cannot continue.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This indicates that 7-Zip is not installed or that 7za is not located in /usr/bin.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Other exceptions or crashes on startup.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Any other error message is probably related to SQLite3 not being installed or detected by Mono.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">I'm having other problems running GBM in Linux!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM in Linux is very much experimental at this time. Please <a href="https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/issues?q=is%3Aissue">report any issues</a>!</li>
