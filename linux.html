                <p class="large">Can I run GBM on Linux?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>As of the latest v0.96 pre-release, GBM will run on Linux using Mono.  You can detect and backup Linux native games and games running in Wine.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="large">What's required to run GBM on Linux?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>GBM requires a few prerequisites to be installed.  Some of these may be pre-installed on your distribution.
                        <ul>                            
                            <li>Mono Framework
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Visit <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">mono-project.com</a> for the best way to install this on your distro.</li>                                    
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Mono Visual Basic .NET support and WinForms
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The <b>mono-vbnc</b> package and it's dependencies will cover this on Debain based distros.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>SQLite3 library

                                    <li>The <b>libsqlite3-0</b> package on Debain based distros.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                <p class="large">How do I install and run GBM on Linux?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Download the latest package from <a href="https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/releases">Releases</a> and extract it to a folder.  Navigate to the folder in a terminal and use the command <b>mono GBM.exe</b> to run it.</li>   
                    </ul>
                <p class="large">Are there any limitations while running in Linux?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unfortunately there's a few:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The tray icon and menu will not function in Linux and are disabled.  You can minimize GBM to the task bar instead.</li>
                                <li>All automatic file/folder searches are disabled in Linux due to being unreliable.  This feature will be enabled again once I get around to fixing it in Mono.</li>
                                <li>You may encounter slight visual glitches with the interface, mostly with listbox controls.  These glitches are related to Mono and your video driver or version.</li>
                                <li>GBM may not exit cleanly if a critical error occurs, the process will need to be killed.</li>
                            </ul> 
                        </li>  
                    </ul>
                <p class="large">How do I configure GBM to detect Wine games?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You don't need to do anything special.  Simply set the process to the game's executable name (without the extension), exactly like you do while using GBM on Windows.</li>
                        <li>Please note that while GBM will display the game running as "wine-preloader", it still knows game's actual working directory and will properly backup a relative path configuration.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="large">Can GBM share the same backup folder between Linux and Windows?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes it can, you can play a game on Linux and restore your saved games to continue on your Windows machine and vice versa.</li>
                        <li>There are some important tips you should know before doing this.</li>
                            <ol>
                            	<li>Linux and Windows will very rarely share the same game configurations.  Disable the "Sync game list data with backup folder" option in Settings, then use seperate configurations on each OS with matching names.</li>
                            	<li>The restore path will be displayed incorrectly when restoring saved games between operating systems, but GBM will automatically detect and fix the path when you do a restore, just choose Yes to the confirmation!</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="large">I'm getting an error message when I run GBM!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The following are some common errors and the reason:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The entry point method could not be loaded.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This indicates that Mono Visual Basic or WinForms support is not installed.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>7-Zip was not found.  The application cannot continue.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This indicates that 7-Zip is not installed or that 7za is not located in /usr/bin.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Other exceptions or crashes on startup.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Any other error message is probably related to SQLite3 not being installed or detected by Mono.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>                                
                            </ul>
