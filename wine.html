            Wine F.A.Q

            <p class="large">What is Wine?</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> is a compatibility layer for Linux, Mac OS and other operating systems that allows you to run Microsoft Windows applications or games.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Can I run GBM in Linux or other operating systems with Wine?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You can, but it's not recommended due to the limitations (see below).</li>
              <li>GBM requires .NET 4 to be installed in the Wine prefix it's running in. The 64-bit edition of GBM will also require a 64-bit prefix.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">What are the limitations of GBM while it's running in Wine?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM can only detect games that are running in the same Wine prefix. It will not be able to detect any native games or games running in a separate prefix. If you'd like to detect native games AND Wine games run GBM with <a href="linux.html">Mono</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">I'm having a problem while running GBM in Wine! What can I do?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Wine is extremely good at what it does, but you may still encounter some glitches with the GBM interface or other problems. Any major issues can be reported via github or email, but I can't promise they'll be fixed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why can't I get GBM working in Wine?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GBM is not tested with, nor designed to run on Wine. I can make no guarantee that it's going to work well, or even at all with the various versions of Wine and operating systems available.</li>
