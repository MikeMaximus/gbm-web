            Game Launcher F.A.Q
          </div>
          <div class="pageSectionContent">
            <p class="large">Why would I use Game Backup Monitor to my launch games?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Game Backup Monitor is always available in the system tray, making it a quick way to launch a game.</li>
              <li>After a game has been detected at least once, GBM usually has all the information required to launch it.</li>              
              <li>This makes GBM a lightweight and simple game launcher, but advanced customization options are available if required.</li>
              <li>This feature is fully optional and completely invisible by default if you don't want to use it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why can't I launch games with Game Backup Monitor?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The game launching feature is disabled by default, it must be enabled in the General section of File -> Settings.</li>
              <li>The "Session Tracking" feature must also be enabled for certain launch options to become available, but it's not required.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">How do I launch games with Game Backup Monitor?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Launch any of the last five recently played games by right-clicking the system tray icon and choosing the game you'd like to play.</li>
              <li>Use the "Quick Launcher" to find and launch any configured game.  It's accessed via the File menu, tray menu or using "Ctrl + L" on the main window.</li>
              <li>Launch any game directly from the Game Manager using the "Launch Options" button.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why do I always get an error about missing information when trying to launch my games?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Most games will need to be detected for at least one session in v1.2.4 or higher before GBM has enough information to automatically launch it.  You can also manually provide the information required to launch a game in the Game Manager.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why can't I launch a game even after it's been detected once?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In rare cases, required information such as the "Game Path" can't be detected.  The reason is usually displayed in the log.  When this happens you can manually set the missing information in the Game Manager.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Why do some of my games crash when I launch them from Game Backup Monitor?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>This can be a problem with certain games purchased on services such as Steam or Epic Game Store.</li>
              <li>Some games will simply refuse to work properly when launched directly from their executable and they need to launched with their respective store client.  This can be DRM related or simply a bug.</li>
              <li>GBM supports launching games through compatible store clients, but the game must be manually configured to do so in the Game Manager.</li>
            </ul>            
            <p class="large">I need to launch certain games as Administrator or with compatability settings.  Is this supported?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Yes.  Any game executable flagged to "Run As Administrator" will request elevation as it normally does and will use any compatability settings.</li>
              <li>In addition, any game launched while GBM is running as Administrator will automatically launch as Administrator.  However this is not recommended, and GBM will ask for confirmation before every launch.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">Is this feature supported on Linux?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Yes, with one limitation.  Any Windows game you are attempting to launch from GBM in Linux will need to be manually configured to launch via an external launcher or script.</li>
              <li>A future release may support automatically building the launch command using detected Wine/Proton information, but it will not be supported initially.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="large">I don't understand how Game Backup Monitor is launching my games.  How does this work?</p>
            <ul>              
              <li>Please see the <a href="manual.html#launcher">manual</a> for more details and advanced information.</li>
