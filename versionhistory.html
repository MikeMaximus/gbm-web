            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added the ability to launch games.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Games are launched using information GBM has automatically detected or can be fully customized via the Game Manager.
                        <ul>
                          <li>Most games will need to be detected at least once in v1.2.4 or higher before they can be automatically launched using this feature.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>                      
                      <li>Launch any configured game using the "Quick Launcher".
                        <ul>
                          <li>The Quick Launcher is available in the File menu, system tray menu and by using "Ctrl + L" on the main window.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Launch any configured game directly from the Game Manager.</li>
                      <li>Launch the last five games played from the system tray menu.
                        <ul>
                          <li>The "Session Tracking" feature needs to be enabled and have enough recorded data to display any recently played games in the system tray menu.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  <li>Added the ability to customize game launch options.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added "Launch Settings..." button to Game Manager.
                        <ul>
                          <li>Allows the configuration of another launcher (such as Steam) to start the game instead of directly using an executable.
                            <ul>
                              <li>You can manage available launchers using the Launcher Manager. Some popular launchers will be preconfigured.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                        </ul>                        
                      </li>
                      <li>Allows the use of an alternate executable or script.</li>
                      <li>Allows setting alternate launch parameters (or disabling them).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The process path is now always saved once a game has been detected.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Priors versions of GBM only saved the process path when it was required for backup or detection purposes.</li>
                      <li>A warning will now be displayed in the log when the process path cannot be determined.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Session time (and total time played) will now update(once per minute) on the main window, instead of only being displayed after the game ends.</li>              
                  <li>Session time will now be displayed and update(once per minute) on the GBM tray icon tooltip.</li>
                  <li>Disabled features will now have their options removed from all menus. This currently only applies to session tracking and game launching.</li>
                  <li>Fixed issues that prevented configuration save paths from being updated correctly when a custom variable is modified or deleted.</li>
                  <li>Deleting a custom variable will now properly remove the environment variable in the current session and update any affected game configurations.</li>
                  <li>Editing a configuration while using a Custom filter on the Game Manager will no longer lose the changes if any tags are modified before saving.</li>
                  <li>Modifying tags on a single configuration while using a Custom filter on the Game Manager will no longer unselect the current configuration.</li>
                  <li>Any form that asks to save unchanged data on closing, will no longer just close and lose the changes if the form fails validation when choosing to save.</li>
                  <li>Double right-clicking the tray icon no longer triggers "Restore Window".</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows:
                <ul>
                  <li>GBM will no longer crash if the UAC prompt is cancelled while restarting as Administrator.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.2.3</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Improvements to the "Choose Game" window	
                    <ul>
                      <li>It should now always be displayed in front of other windows after closing a game.</li>
                      <li>It now appears in the taskbar, just in case it does get hidden behind other windows.</li>
                      <li>The GBM icon is now displayed on this window.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Improvements to the "Import Game Configurations" window
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added "Show Only Selected" option.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This option will filter the current list to show only currently selected configurations.</li>
                          <li>This option can be combined with the text filter.</li>
                        </ul>                        
                      </li>
                      <li>Added "Detect Saved Games" button.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This button allows you to detect configurations with saved games.  This has always been automatically done when the form is opened, but the button is useful if you need to start over.</li>
                          <li>Using this button will not unselect any configurations you manually selected.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Configurations in an import list that use only a special folder(or custom variable) as the save path, will no longer be incorrectly selected when detecting saved games.
                        <ul>
                          <li>These types of configurations cannot currently be detected, this only fixes them being selected by mistake.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>You can now maximize or minimize this window.</li>
                      <li>Increased the default size of the window.</li>
                      <li>The GBM icon is now displayed on this window and it now appears in the taskbar.</li>
                    </ul>                    
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <li>Windows:
                <ul>
                  <li>Simplified the code used to hide the main window.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Prevents the weird flicker effect that could occur when clicking the close button.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Updated SQLite to 3.33.0</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>            
            <h3>1.2.2</h3>
            <ul>         
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added new settings to customize the UI
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added "Exit when closing main window"
                        <ul>
                          <li>Allows the user to exit the app completely when closing the main window, instead of hiding it.</li>
                          <li>This option defaults to enabled in Linux and disabled in Windows.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Added "Exit without confirmation"
                        <ul>
                          <li>Allows the user to exit the app without the confirmation pop-up.</li>
                          <li>This defaults to disabled in both Linux and Windows.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Attempted to unify how the UI functions in Windows / Linux and reduce the amount of platform specific work-arounds.
                    <ul>
                      <li>You can now minimize the main window to the taskbar in Windows.</li>
                      <li>You can no longer double-click the tray icon or use the "Show / Hide" option to toggle the visibility of the main window.
                        <ul>
                          <li>The "Show / Hide" option has been replaced by "Restore Window".</li>
                          <li>Double-clicking the tray icon or using "Restore Window" will always restore the app to a normal, visible state and give it focus.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Unfortunately, the main window cannot be hidden in Linux. In cases where it's supposed to be hidden, it will be minimized instead.
                        <ul>
                          <li>Hiding the main window in Linux requires too many work-arounds and my goal was to reduce the amount of platform specific code.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Improved platform detection.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The "About Game Backup Monitor" window will now display which platform the app is running on (Mono or .NET) and the version.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Reduced the amount of platform specific code when the app initalizes, this may improve performance.</li>
                  <li>The "Start-Up Wizard" will now always appear in the center of screen, instead of sometimes appearing in a random location.</li>
                  <li>The system tray menu is now disabled during the "Start-Up Wizard".</li>
                  <li>Updated window titles on the custom folder browsers to give more concise instructions.</li>
                  <li>Fixed the forced import of multiple backup files when using the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>It will now create manifest entries for each file when appropriate, instead of just the newest file.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed the incorrect save path being stored in the metadata when making backups from games running in Proton / Wine.</li>
                  <li>Moved the wine path detection output into a debug mode instead of cluttering up the log.</li>
                  <li>The Include/Exclude builder on the Game Manager will now properly open to the Proton / Wine saved game path when possible.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.2.1</h3>
            <ul>         
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a possible crash when renaming a game with existing backup files while a cloud client is monitoring the backup folder.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a rare issue that could cause the wrong game to be pre-selected when opening the Game Manager.</li>
                  <li>Fixed an issue causing the ampersand character to be hidden in certain controls.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Ex. Mount & Blade II: Bannerlords will now be displayed correctly.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Various changes for debugging and building releases.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>    
              <li>Windows:
                <ul>
                  <li>Installers are now built with NSIS 3.05</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>The system tray icon is now enabled for desktop environments that support it (Cinnamon, LXDE).
                    <ul>
                      <li>You'll need an up-to-date version of Mono for the tray icon to work, tested with Mono 6.8.0.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that caused opening external apps to fail when using the latest versions of Mono.</li>                
                </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>              
            <h3>1.2.0</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added the ability to easily backup or restore the entire game list.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use the "Run Full Backup" or "Run Full Restore" options in the File menu or Tray menu to easily backup or restore your entire game list.</li>
                      <li>Any confirmations or checks requiring user input are automatically handled when using these tools. See the "Full Backup and Restore" section of the manual for details.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Added the ability to "link" game configurations.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This allows any linked configuration(s) to automatically run a backup or restore each time their parent is triggered. This can continue in a chain.</li>
                      <li>This feature allows for the proper configuration of rare games that stored their saved games in multiple unique locations. It may also have other creative uses.</li>
                      <li>Please read "Link -> Configuration" in the "Game Manager" section of the manual for details on exactly how this feature works.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Metadata is now added to all backup files.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This is a small XML file that contains important information about the archive and the configuration used to make the backup.</li>
                      <li>This allows GBM and possibly any other software to easily identify and use GBM backup files.</li>
                      <li>This file is not extracted when restoring a backup, it will not be cluttering up your saved game folders.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>All backup operations are now performed in a temporary folder before the resulting file is moved to the backup folder.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This change was required to fix periodic issues with cloud software (Dropbox) locking backup files while they were being created.</li>
                      <li>The temporary folder can be manually set in "Settings -> Backup and Restore", it defaults to %LOCALAPPDATA%\gbm (~/.local/share/gbm).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Improved the ability to import backup files using metadata.
                    <ul>
                      <li>There is a now a global tool to import backup files or entire folders available in the "Tools" menu.</li>
                      <li>Only backup files with GBM metadata can be imported using this new tool.</li>
                      <li>You may still force the import of any 7z archive using the "Import Backup Files" tool in the Game Manager.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>GBM now properly checks for available disk space when doing batch operations.</li>
                  <li>GBM no longer attempts to search for a game when the process name is a regular expression, it isn't supported.</li>
                  <li>Fixed various long-standing problems with the "Cancel" button.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Using "Cancel" during a backup or restore now properly cancels out of batch operations.</li>
                      <li>Using the "Cancel" button no longer prevents future operations from executing properly.</li>
                    </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a bug on the Game Manager that caused the "Save Entire Folder" checkbox to be unchecked anytime the "Save Path" field was changed.</li>
                  <li>The "Add Game Wizard" now allows you to set an unlimited number of backups.</li>
                  <li>The "Backup Limit" label has been updated to indicate that 0 means unlimited.</li>
                  <li>The "Open Backup File" button on the Game Manager is now called "Open Backup". It now gives a choice between opening the backup file or the folder containing the file.</li>
                  <li>Set rules are now used for backup folder and file names, regardless of the operating system GBM is running on.
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM now always filters out NTFS reserved characters and allows a maximum file name length of 255.</li>
                      <li>This will prevent various problems when using a backup drive with a non-standard file system in Linux or Windows.</li>
                      <li>These rules will be applied to new backup files or folders, existing backups not be modified.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Made improvements to the Start-Up Wizard.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The default backup location now includes a "Game Backup Monitor" sub-folder.</li>
                      <li>The wizard will now automatically create the backup location if it doesn't exist.</li>
                      <li>You can no longer attempt to Import Backup Files during the Start-Up Wizard.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a bug that caused the "Available Disk Space" check to fail if the backup folder contained one or more spaces.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.8</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added the ability to backup and restore saved games that are stored in the Windows registry:
                    <ul>
                      <li>This feature is also supported in Linux for Windows games running in Wine/Proton.</li>
                      <li>Please see the <a href="http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#registry">online manual</a> for more details on how to use this feature.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>On startup, GBM now waits up to one minute for the current backup location to become available before displaying an error message.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The error message can now be canceled to continue waiting.</li>
                      <li>This is useful for delayed network shares on startup or if you forgot to plug in an external backup drive.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The "Choose Game" window now displays tags in addition to the game name when multiple configurations are detected.</li>
                  <li>The "Backup Confirmation" window should now always get top focus after a gaming session ends.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This fix has also been applied to other important messages to make sure they don't get hidden behind other windows.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The Game Manager and Custom Variable Manager now use a different folder browser where applicable.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The new browser provides better usability for power users, other areas of the app will still use the classic folder browser.</li>
                      <li>The new browser allows Linux users to "Show Hidden Folders", which can't be done using the classic Folder Browser.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>When a UNC path is used for the backup folder, the disk space check prior to backups will be automatically disabled because it cannot be done.</li>
                  <li>The disk space check prior to backups can now be disabled in the "Backup and Restore" settings.</li>
                  <li>Added "Operating System" field to game configurations:
                    <ul>
                      <li>"Windows" and "Linux" are the only valid choices at this time and only Linux users are allowed to change this field.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Changed how GBM initilizes on startup to fix some long standing issues.</li>
                  <li>Fixed some inconsistencies with form icons and when forms are shown in the task bar.</li>
                  <li>GBM no longer provides a warning about "Syncing Game IDs" when importing configurations in the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The warning was very confusing and is no longer relevant to most users.</li>
                      <li>The "Sync Game IDs" Tool will continue to be available for now, but the messaging has been changed warning not to use it without reading the manual first.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>        
              <li>Windows:
                <ul>
                  <li>Updated SQLite to 3.27.2</li>
                  <li>Updated 7-Zip to 19.00</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>You can now set GBM to automatically start on log-in via the "Startup" settings.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This requires that GBM be installed via a package manager or the makefile, so any required files are in a known location.  The option will be disabled otherwise.</li>
                      <li>The "Start Minimized" option is now available in "Startup" settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>GBM now stores all Wine configuration data seperately from the core game configuration:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The core configuration is no longer altered in any way when a game is detected running in Wine or Proton.</li>
                      <li>The Wine configuration data is now automatically updated each time a game is detected, such as when running the game from a new prefix.</li>
                      <li>This data can be viewed and manually modified on the Game Manager.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Fixed the handling of Wine/Proton games when multiple configurations are detected.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a crash when using "Backup Only" and "New Backups Pending" filters on the Game Manager.</li>
                  <li>The Mono and GBM process will now exit cleanly if a critical error occurs during startup.</li>
                  <li>GBM will no longer show the exit dialog when a critical error occurs.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.7</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that caused the include/exclude builder to crash GBM when a save path contained illegal characters.</li>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that prevented GBM from recording the correct time spent playing a game, when that game was played over consecutive sessions.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.6</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added support for games that save to the Windows %PROGRAMDATA% location.</li>
                  <li>The Game Manager now automatically selects the last detected game when opened.</li>
                  <li>Backup files can no longer be imported into a "Monitor Only" configuration.</li>
                  <li>Optimized the memory and cpu usage of Regular Expressions when monitoring for games.</li>
                  <li>Added a "Recurse sub-folders" option
                    <ul>
                      <li>This option is set per game configuration, it is available on Include/Exclude window of the Game Manager and Add Game Wizard.</li>
                      <li>It is enabled by default on all current and new configurations.</li>
                      <li>Disabling this option prevents 7-Zip and GBM from scanning every sub-folder and file of a save path. This useful when backing up specific files inside an extremely large folder.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Fixed a possible issue with backups when the configuration uses folder path includes.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a memory leak issue with Mono and Regular Expressions.</li>
                  <li>Fixed some issues when detecting the prefix of Wine/Proton games.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The default prefix (~/.wine) will be assumed when a detected game does not have the WINEPREFIX variable set.</li>
                      <li>A prefix can now be fully detected when it contains spaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Windows configurations that use a relative save path are now properly converted when detected in Wine/Proton.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>            
            <h3>1.1.5</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a crash that could occur when renaming a game configuration.</li>
                  <li>Rewrote portions of game detection:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The handling of duplicate game configurations has been flawed since regular expression support was added in v1.1. This has been fixed.</li>
                      <li>GBM is now more efficient when detecting games by parameter and/or process path.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Changed how save path variables are handled:
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM no longer uses it's own format and naming scheme for path variables.</li>
                      <li>GBM now uses Windows environment variables in game configurations.
                        <ul>
                          <li>For example, *appdatalocal* is now %LOCALAPPDATA% in a Windows configuration.</li>
                          <li>GBM also uses some custom environment variables, such as %USERDOCUMENTS% and %COMMONDOCUMENTS%. These are needed for compatability and to handle some limitations with how GBM interacts with 7-Zip.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>GBM now uses the XDG specification for game configurations in Linux. (Thanks basxto!)
                        <ul>
                          <li>For example, *appdatalocal* is now ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share} in a Linux configuration.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Custom Path Variables have changed. For example, *Steam User Data* will now be %Steam User Data%.
                        <ul>
                          <li>They will appear this way in Windows and Linux.</li>
                          <li>GBM will no longer allows the creation of variables using reserved names, such as APPDATA.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Your configurations will be automatically updated to these new formats when upgrading to v1.1.5.</li>
                      <li>These changes will break game list compatability with other versions of GBM. Archived lists are available at <a href="http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/archive.html">http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/archive.html</a> for those that wish to stay on an older version.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added a new setting, "Show resolved save paths in Game Manager".
                    <ul>
                      <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                      <li>When enabled, GBM will display resolved save paths in the Game Manager. This is how GBM displayed paths prior to v1.1.5.</li>
                      <li>When disabled, GBM will display save paths with their variables when applicable.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added a tooltip to applicable "Path" fields on the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This tooltip either displays either a resolved or unresolved path.</li>
                      <li>The behaviour is toggled by the "Show resolved save paths" setting.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added "Import Backup Files" feature to the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This feature allows you to import one or more backup files for a specific game configuration.</li>
                      <li>This is useful if you lost your GBM database(s), but not the backup files. It also can be used to easily move compatible saved game backups between Windows and Linux.</li>
                      <li>GBM cannot verify that the backups being imported are compatible with the current configuration. This is up to the user!</li>
                      <li>This feature will be expanded and refined in future releases.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that prevented Wine / Proton games from being detected in some cases.</li>
                  <li>GBM can now use any Windows configuration to detect and backup games running in Wine / Proton.
                    <ul>
                      <li>An absolute Windows save path, such "%APPDATA%\Game\Saved Games" will be automatically converted to the proper path within the detected Wine prefix.</li>
                      <li>The converted path will be saved to the configuration once game has been detected at least once.</li>
                      <li>You cannot restore a backup using an absolute Windows path. The game needs to be detected at least once so the correct save path can be determined.</li>
                      <li>This feature should be considered "Beta" and may not work in all scenarios. Please report any issues you may encounter!</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Website:

                <ul>
                    <li>Game tags are now sorted alphanumerically on the Game Manager and in XML exports.</li>
                    <li>GBM now displays a unique backup overwrite warning for games that use a relative saved game path.</li>
                    <li>The "Save Multiple Backups" setting now allows infinite backups when "Backup Limit" is set to 0. This is now the default for new configurations.</li>
                    <li>"Save Multiple Backups" and "Backup Limit" are now core fields, they are synced by default and included in the Import/Export.</li>
                    <li>The Game Manager will now clean up it's own manifest when backup files are deleted outside of GBM. As to not affect performance, this only occurs when the "Backup Data" field is accessed.</li>
                    <li>When a single game is selected, the Game Manager now restores the currently selected backup, instead of always restoring the latest backup.</li>
                    <li>If possible, GBM now displays the full path of the detected process when multiple configurations are triggered.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that could cause certain controls to become enabled incorrectly on the Game Manager.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM not to remove empty sub-folders unless the "Use Game ID for files and folders" setting was enabled when the folder was created.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM not to rename backup files or sub-folders unless the "Use Game ID for files and folders" setting was enabled.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM to only rename the most current backup file when modifying a Name or Game ID.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Modified "Quick Filter" behavior on the Game Manager.
                      <ul>
                        <li>The game list now becomes disabled when typing in the Quick Filter and enabled only when the filter has finished running.</li>
                        <li>When using the Quick Filter, the currently selected game will be automatically deselected.</li>
                        <li>These changes prevent the Game Manager from entering an unstable state after using the Quick Filter.</li>

            <h3>1.1.0</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Core Design Changes (Game Configuration)
                    <ul>
                      <li>Game ID is now exposed to the user and can be changed.  This feature is mainly for developer and contributer usage.</li>
                      <li>Game ID is generated automatically by GBM or acquired from an import, the user doesn't need to set it unless they want to.</li>
                      <li>Game ID (instead of Game Name) can now be used to name backup files and folders.
                        <ul>
                          <li>GBM will continue to use the name by default for ease of use.</li>
                          <li>This behavior can be toggled in the "Backup and Restore" section of Settings.</li>
                          <li>Using the game Name for backup files has a minor risk associated with it. See "Known Issue #2 and #4" for more details.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Game Name can now contain any character.</li>
                      <li>When a game is deleted via Game Manager (or sync), all backup manifest entries for that particular game are now deleted. The backup files themselves are not.</li>
                      <li>The Game Manager now syncs changes to the remote database immediately, instead of only when closed.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Feature Additions &amp; Changes
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added Regular Expression support for game detection.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This feature allows GBM to detect games based on a pattern instead of a single process name.</li>
                          <li>This allows GBM to better support games that run from multiple executables and games that use interpreters or emulators.</li>
                          <li>Use the new "Regular Expression" checkbox on the Game Manager and enter the pattern in the "Process" field.</li>
                          <li>GBM will validate patterns and offer to help troubleshoot (using regexr.com) when validation fails.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added the ability to start another process (or multiple processes) whenever a game is detected.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is useful to automatically start utilities, such as custom control schemes or overlays when a specific game is detected.</li>
                          <li>The "Process Manager" allows you to manage any programs you'd like to launch.</li>
                          <li>The "Processes..." button on the Game Manager allows you to assign processes to any selected game.</li>
                          <li>A process can be set to end when the game is closed.</li>
                          <li>Processes and related settings are specific to the local machine only.  They are not synced to the backup folder and are not part of the import/export.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added "Backup GBM data files on launch" to the settings.  A long overdue feature, this will backup both the remote and local databases (as gbm.s3db.launch.bak) each time GBM starts.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                          <li>Only one backup is kept, the prior one will be overwritten.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added the ability to display messages or warnings that can be suppressed after one view.  These messages can be reset via the Settings screen.</li>
                      <li>The "Enable Sync" feature is now mandatory and the option been removed from Settings.</li>
                      <li>The "Clean Local Manifest" feature has been removed.  It is not required because manfiest entries are no longer orphaned by design.  Existing orphaned entries will be removed during the v1.1.0 database upgrade.</li>
                      <li>Added "Sync Game IDs" feature.  This allows the user to update their game configuration identifiers to match the official list or an export file.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is mainly an optional upgrade tool for users with existing data from older versions.  It allows the import feature to properly recognize and update game configurations.</li>
                          <li>The sync is based on similarly named game configurations, therefore it's not 100% effective.  Some games may be missed and require manual changes.</li>
                          <li>If you share a backup folder with multiple PCs, this feature will cause some data loss when the new IDs are synced to the other PCs.  See "Known Issue #1"</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added "Disable sync event messages" to the settings.  This will remove all sync related information messages in the log.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                          <li>Sync messages can cause a lot of useless clutter in the log and are not useful to most users.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Re-organized the Setting screen to clear up some space for the future.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Import / Export Changes
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM now uses the Game ID to determine if a game is new or has an updated configuration.</li>
                      <li>GBM will offer to "Sync Game IDs" when importing from the official list after upgrading to v1.1.0.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This allows the import to recognize and update your configurations from older versions.</li>
                          <li>This offer only appears once and only appears for users that have upgraded from an older version.	</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added icons to the import list to indicate a "New" or "Updated" game.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Updated session CSV export to adhere to RFC 4180.  It now handles commas, quotes and line breaks correctly.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>Updated 7-Zip to v18.01</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>GBM now uses notify-send (libnotify) if it's available to display notifications on Linux.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Mono style notifications will be displayed if notify-send is not available.</li>
                      <li>The GBM icon will be displayed on notifications if it's been installed via the makefile or a package installer.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Known Issues:
                <ol>
                  <li>If one or more Game IDs are changed (manually or via Game ID Sync) on one computer and these changes are synced to another PC sharing the same backup folder, the following data will be lost.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The local session data on that PC for the changed game(s) will be lost.</li>
                      <li>The local backup manifest data for the changed game(s) on that PC will be lost.  GBM will see any backups for the changed game(s) as new and will handle them accordingly.</li>
                      <li>Any processes assigned to the changed games(s) on that PC will be lost.</li>
                      <li>Once your PCs are back in sync, this will no longer be an issue unless you are constantly changing your Game IDs, which is not recommended.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Backup files are not being renamed or removed when a new backup is created.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This happens on the first backup after toggling between using the Name or ID for your file names.  It's best to choose one setting and stick with it.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>The error "The requested operation requires elevation" occurs when GBM tries to launch a process associated with a game.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This means the process you're trying to launch with GBM requires administrator privilege.</li>
                      <li>Click the blue "user" icon on the bottom left of the GBM window to quickly switch to administrator mode.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Game configurations using the same name, and configurations that end up with the same name when special characters are stripped will overwrite each other's backup files.
                    <ul>
                      <li>For most users this should be a non-issue.  Toggle "Use Game ID for folder and file names" to on in the Settings screen if this is a problem for you.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Important Notices:
                <ol>
                  <li>Configurations on the official game lists are no longer compatible with older GBM versions.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Configurations can now use Regular Expressions to detect when a game is running, which old versions of GBM will not understand how to handle.</li>
                      <li>Configurations can now use any character in the game name, which may cause backups to fail in old versions of GBM.</li>
                      <li>The last official lists compatible with v1.0.7 and prior versions are <a href="archive.html">archived and available to download</a> from the GBM website for users who wish to stay on an older version.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
              </li>

                      <li>Fixed issues with date sorting, it will now sort correctly regardless of format.</li>
                      <li>The recording of short sessions can now be ignored using a setting.</li>
                    </ul></li>                  
                  <li>Changed setting "Backup only when session time exceeds XX minutes" to "Ignore sessions shorter than XX minutes".
                    <ul>

              <li>You can now multi-select on the Game Manager screen to delete multiple games.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a critical bug with the Game Manager which allowed you to add duplicate entries. This resulted in a crash and the inability start the app again. 0.81 fixes this bug and will repair any database broken by this issue so the app will function again. (Thanks Nirth from GOG.com)</li>
              <li>Fixed an annoying bug where extra game data was being lost when syncing hours spent between computers.</li>

              <li>64-bit build available, this will allow GBM to fully detect 64 bit and 32 bit applications. (32-bit will be default download)</li>
              <li>Switched back-end from XML to SQLite 3. Old configurations will be imported and upgraded.</li>
              <li>Automatic syncing of game list and applicable extra data (such as Hours played) between computers sharing the same backup folder. See "Notes on Automatic Syncing" in the manual.</li>

              <li>In the rare instance the user is asked to manually find a path, GBM will now search for the location automatically.</li>

            <ul>
