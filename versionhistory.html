            <h3 class="notop">1.1.6</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added support for games that save to the Windows %PROGRAMDATA% location.</li>
                  <li>The Game Manager now automatically selects the last detected game when opened.</li>
                  <li>Backup files can no longer be imported into a "Monitor Only" configuration.</li>
                  <li>Optimized the memory and cpu usage of Regular Expressions when monitoring for games.</li>
                  <li>Added a "Recurse sub-folders" option
                    <ul>
                      <li>This option is set per game configuration, it is available on Include/Exclude window of the Game Manager and Add Game Wizard.</li>
                      <li>It is enabled by default on all current and new configurations.</li>
                      <li>Disabling this option prevents 7-Zip and GBM from scanning every sub-folder and file of a save path. This useful when backing up specific files inside an extremely large folder.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Fixed a possible issue with backups when the configuration uses folder path includes.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a memory leak issue with Mono and Regular Expressions.</li>
                  <li>Fixed some issues when detecting the prefix of Wine/Proton games.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The default prefix (~/.wine) will be assumed when a detected game does not have the WINEPREFIX variable set.</li>
                      <li>A prefix can now be fully detected when it contains spaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Windows configurations that use a relative save path are now properly converted when detected in Wine/Proton.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>            
            <h3>1.1.5</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a crash that could occur when renaming a game configuration.</li>
                  <li>Rewrote portions of game detection:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The handling of duplicate game configurations has been flawed since regular expression support was added in v1.1. This has been fixed.</li>
                      <li>GBM is now more efficient when detecting games by parameter and/or process path.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Changed how save path variables are handled:
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM no longer uses it's own format and naming scheme for path variables.</li>
                      <li>GBM now uses Windows environment variables in game configurations.
                        <ul>
                          <li>For example, *appdatalocal* is now %LOCALAPPDATA% in a Windows configuration.</li>
                          <li>GBM also uses some custom environment variables, such as %USERDOCUMENTS% and %COMMONDOCUMENTS%. These are needed for compatability and to handle some limitations with how GBM interacts with 7-Zip.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>GBM now uses the XDG specification for game configurations in Linux. (Thanks basxto!)
                        <ul>
                          <li>For example, *appdatalocal* is now ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share} in a Linux configuration.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Custom Path Variables have changed. For example, *Steam User Data* will now be %Steam User Data%.
                        <ul>
                          <li>They will appear this way in Windows and Linux.</li>
                          <li>GBM will no longer allows the creation of variables using reserved names, such as APPDATA.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Your configurations will be automatically updated to these new formats when upgrading to v1.1.5.</li>
                      <li>These changes will break game list compatability with other versions of GBM. Archived lists are available at <a href="http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/archive.html">http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/archive.html</a> for those that wish to stay on an older version.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added a new setting, "Show resolved save paths in Game Manager".
                    <ul>
                      <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                      <li>When enabled, GBM will display resolved save paths in the Game Manager. This is how GBM displayed paths prior to v1.1.5.</li>
                      <li>When disabled, GBM will display save paths with their variables when applicable.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added a tooltip to applicable "Path" fields on the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This tooltip either displays either a resolved or unresolved path.</li>
                      <li>The behaviour is toggled by the "Show resolved save paths" setting.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added "Import Backup Files" feature to the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This feature allows you to import one or more backup files for a specific game configuration.</li>
                      <li>This is useful if you lost your GBM database(s), but not the backup files. It also can be used to easily move compatible saved game backups between Windows and Linux.</li>
                      <li>GBM cannot verify that the backups being imported are compatible with the current configuration. This is up to the user!</li>
                      <li>This feature will be expanded and refined in future releases.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that prevented Wine / Proton games from being detected in some cases.</li>
                  <li>GBM can now use any Windows configuration to detect and backup games running in Wine / Proton.
                    <ul>
                      <li>An absolute Windows save path, such "%APPDATA%\Game\Saved Games" will be automatically converted to the proper path within the detected Wine prefix.</li>
                      <li>The converted path will be saved to the configuration once game has been detected at least once.</li>
                      <li>You cannot restore a backup using an absolute Windows path. The game needs to be detected at least once so the correct save path can be determined.</li>
                      <li>This feature should be considered "Beta" and may not work in all scenarios. Please report any issues you may encounter!</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Website:
                <ul>
                  <li>Search features have been added to the Official Game Lists (Thanks basxto!)
                    <ul>
                      <li>Includes advanced features such as searching by tag and excludes.</li>
                      <li>Tags are now clickable for automatic searching of similar games.</li>
                      <li>Searches are linkable.</li>
                      <li>You can now link directly to a single configuration using the new link icon.</li>
                      <li>Configurations intelligently collapse or uncollapse based on search results.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.4</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Changed method of handling required OS environment paths and added a new path check on startup.</li>
                  <li>Incorrect conflict warnings will no longer be shown in some situations when running a backup configuration with "Save Multiple Backups" enabled.</li>
                  <li>Fixed the precision of "Total Hours" on the Session Viewer, it now always rounds to 2 decimal places.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>GBM will no longer keep an open file handle on detected processes and custom icons.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                  <ul>
                  <li>Sorting by "Hours" in the Session Viewer will no longer crash GBM on certain systems.</li>
                  <li>GBM no longer attempts to get icons from a Linux binary.</li>
                  <li>Removed compression from GBM icon to prevent issues with recent versions of imagemagick.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.3</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms
                <ul>
                    <li>Game tags are now sorted alphanumerically on the Game Manager and in XML exports.</li>
                    <li>GBM now displays a unique backup overwrite warning for games that use a relative saved game path.</li>
                    <li>The "Save Multiple Backups" setting now allows infinite backups when "Backup Limit" is set to 0. This is now the default for new configurations.</li>
                    <li>"Save Multiple Backups" and "Backup Limit" are now core fields, they are synced by default and included in the Import/Export.</li>
                    <li>The Game Manager will now clean up it's own manifest when backup files are deleted outside of GBM. As to not affect performance, this only occurs when the "Backup Data" field is accessed.</li>
                    <li>When a single game is selected, the Game Manager now restores the currently selected backup, instead of always restoring the latest backup.</li>
                    <li>If possible, GBM now displays the full path of the detected process when multiple configurations are triggered.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that could cause certain controls to become enabled incorrectly on the Game Manager.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM not to remove empty sub-folders unless the "Use Game ID for files and folders" setting was enabled when the folder was created.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM not to rename backup files or sub-folders unless the "Use Game ID for files and folders" setting was enabled.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM to only rename the most current backup file when modifying a Name or Game ID.</li>
                    <li>GBM no longer displays a sync warning when the user deletes all game configurations from the Game Manager.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.2</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Modified "Quick Filter" behavior on the Game Manager.
                      <ul>
                        <li>The game list now becomes disabled when typing in the Quick Filter and enabled only when the filter has finished running.</li>
                        <li>When using the Quick Filter, the currently selected game will be automatically deselected.</li>
                        <li>These changes prevent the Game Manager from entering an unstable state after using the Quick Filter.</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>Updated SQLite to v3.23.1</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>                      
            <h3>1.1.1</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Spelling error fixed in manual backup message</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>Updated 7-Zip to v18.05</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.0</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Core Design Changes (Game Configuration)
                    <ul>
                      <li>Game ID is now exposed to the user and can be changed.  This feature is mainly for developer and contributer usage.</li>
                      <li>Game ID is generated automatically by GBM or acquired from an import, the user doesn't need to set it unless they want to.</li>
                      <li>Game ID (instead of Game Name) can now be used to name backup files and folders.
                        <ul>
                          <li>GBM will continue to use the name by default for ease of use.</li>
                          <li>This behavior can be toggled in the "Backup and Restore" section of Settings.</li>
                          <li>Using the game Name for backup files has a minor risk associated with it. See "Known Issue #2 and #4" for more details.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Game Name can now contain any character.</li>
                      <li>When a game is deleted via Game Manager (or sync), all backup manifest entries for that particular game are now deleted. The backup files themselves are not.</li>
                      <li>The Game Manager now syncs changes to the remote database immediately, instead of only when closed.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Feature Additions &amp; Changes
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added Regular Expression support for game detection.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This feature allows GBM to detect games based on a pattern instead of a single process name.</li>
                          <li>This allows GBM to better support games that run from multiple executables and games that use interpreters or emulators.</li>
                          <li>Use the new "Regular Expression" checkbox on the Game Manager and enter the pattern in the "Process" field.</li>
                          <li>GBM will validate patterns and offer to help troubleshoot (using regexr.com) when validation fails.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added the ability to start another process (or multiple processes) whenever a game is detected.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is useful to automatically start utilities, such as custom control schemes or overlays when a specific game is detected.</li>
                          <li>The "Process Manager" allows you to manage any programs you'd like to launch.</li>
                          <li>The "Processes..." button on the Game Manager allows you to assign processes to any selected game.</li>
                          <li>A process can be set to end when the game is closed.</li>
                          <li>Processes and related settings are specific to the local machine only.  They are not synced to the backup folder and are not part of the import/export.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added "Backup GBM data files on launch" to the settings.  A long overdue feature, this will backup both the remote and local databases (as gbm.s3db.launch.bak) each time GBM starts.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                          <li>Only one backup is kept, the prior one will be overwritten.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added the ability to display messages or warnings that can be suppressed after one view.  These messages can be reset via the Settings screen.</li>
                      <li>The "Enable Sync" feature is now mandatory and the option been removed from Settings.</li>
                      <li>The "Clean Local Manifest" feature has been removed.  It is not required because manfiest entries are no longer orphaned by design.  Existing orphaned entries will be removed during the v1.1.0 database upgrade.</li>
                      <li>Added "Sync Game IDs" feature.  This allows the user to update their game configuration identifiers to match the official list or an export file.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is mainly an optional upgrade tool for users with existing data from older versions.  It allows the import feature to properly recognize and update game configurations.</li>
                          <li>The sync is based on similarly named game configurations, therefore it's not 100% effective.  Some games may be missed and require manual changes.</li>
                          <li>If you share a backup folder with multiple PCs, this feature will cause some data loss when the new IDs are synced to the other PCs.  See "Known Issue #1"</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added "Disable sync event messages" to the settings.  This will remove all sync related information messages in the log.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                          <li>Sync messages can cause a lot of useless clutter in the log and are not useful to most users.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Re-organized the Setting screen to clear up some space for the future.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Import / Export Changes
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM now uses the Game ID to determine if a game is new or has an updated configuration.</li>
                      <li>GBM will offer to "Sync Game IDs" when importing from the official list after upgrading to v1.1.0.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This allows the import to recognize and update your configurations from older versions.</li>
                          <li>This offer only appears once and only appears for users that have upgraded from an older version.	</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added icons to the import list to indicate a "New" or "Updated" game.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Updated session CSV export to adhere to RFC 4180.  It now handles commas, quotes and line breaks correctly.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>Updated 7-Zip to v18.01</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>GBM now uses notify-send (libnotify) if it's available to display notifications on Linux.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Mono style notifications will be displayed if notify-send is not available.</li>
                      <li>The GBM icon will be displayed on notifications if it's been installed via the makefile or a package installer.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Known Issues:
                <ol>
                  <li>If one or more Game IDs are changed (manually or via Game ID Sync) on one computer and these changes are synced to another PC sharing the same backup folder, the following data will be lost.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The local session data on that PC for the changed game(s) will be lost.</li>
                      <li>The local backup manifest data for the changed game(s) on that PC will be lost.  GBM will see any backups for the changed game(s) as new and will handle them accordingly.</li>
                      <li>Any processes assigned to the changed games(s) on that PC will be lost.</li>
                      <li>Once your PCs are back in sync, this will no longer be an issue unless you are constantly changing your Game IDs, which is not recommended.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Backup files are not being renamed or removed when a new backup is created.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This happens on the first backup after toggling between using the Name or ID for your file names.  It's best to choose one setting and stick with it.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>The error "The requested operation requires elevation" occurs when GBM tries to launch a process associated with a game.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This means the process you're trying to launch with GBM requires administrator privilege.</li>
                      <li>Click the blue "user" icon on the bottom left of the GBM window to quickly switch to administrator mode.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Game configurations using the same name, and configurations that end up with the same name when special characters are stripped will overwrite each other's backup files.
                    <ul>
                      <li>For most users this should be a non-issue.  Toggle "Use Game ID for folder and file names" to on in the Settings screen if this is a problem for you.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Important Notices:
                <ol>
                  <li>Configurations on the official game lists are no longer compatible with older GBM versions.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Configurations can now use Regular Expressions to detect when a game is running, which old versions of GBM will not understand how to handle.</li>
                      <li>Configurations can now use any character in the game name, which may cause backups to fail in old versions of GBM.</li>
                      <li>The last official lists compatible with v1.0.7 and prior versions are <a href="archive.html">archived and available to download</a> from the GBM website for users who wish to stay on an older version.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>

                      <li>The recording of short sessions can now be ignored using a setting.</li>
                    </ul></li>                  
                  <li>Changed setting "Backup only when session time exceeds XX minutes" to "Ignore sessions shorter than XX minutes".
                    <ul>
                      <li>This setting is now used to ignore recording sessions times (when enabled) in addition to ignoring a backup.</li>

                  <li>This is an advanced optional feature and is not available in the "Add Game Wizard", please read the manual (http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html) for more details.</li>
                  <li>(Linux) Please note that Wine detection is still handled automatically by GBM and only requires a Windows process name.  But this feature does work with Wine if you need to detect parameters!</li>
                </ul></li>	            
              <li>(All) Added the ability to resize and maximize the main program window.
                <ul>
                  <li>The log is now displayed by default and resizes with the window.</li>
	                <li>The "Show/Hide Log" button has been removed due to technical issues with this change.</li>
                  <li>The minimum window size will let you easily hide the log as in past versions.</li>
                </ul></li>
              <li>(All) The last browse location in various dialogs is now saved, such as when using the Import/Export feature.</li>
              <li>(All) Available disk space is checked before attempting a backup.  The log now displays available disk space and save folder size.</li>

              <li>(All) Tags can now be added to a new game configuration before saving on the Game Manager.</li>
              <li>(All) Fixed various issues when adding new game configurations while using filters on the Game Manager.</li>
              <li>(All) Added better handling of 7-Zip warnings and errors.</li>
              <li>(Linux) GBM now requires the "readlink" utility to properly handle Wine games.  However bash, ls and grep are no longer required.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.0.1</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>(All) Added features to automatically handle new backup files.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Automatically restore new backup files when they are detected.</li>

              </ul>
              <li>(All) Added new configuration option to delete saved game folder on restore.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>This option is used for games that change the file names of their saves, which results in a mix of old and new saved games if the old saves aren't deleted first.</li>
                <li>This option has limitations and is not part of official configurations or import/export features.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>(All) The "Verify backup files with a checksum" option has been removed. This feature is now baked into GBM and cannot be disabled.</li>
              <li>(All) GBM will now behave consistently across different configurations (such as LAN) when performing sync operations.</li>
              <li>(Windows) Fixed rare issue related to DPI display scaling.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.0</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>(Windows) Resolved issues related to DPI display scaling. GBM looks best with scaling disabled via the Compatability tab.</li>
                <li>(All) Very minor bug fixes and tweaks.</li>
			      </ul>
		        <h3>0.98</h3>
            <ul>
				      <li>(All) Redesigned GBM's ability to manage multiple backups per game.
				      <ul>
					      <li>The "Timestamp each backup" option has been renamed "Save multiple backups".</li>
					      <li>You can limit the amount of backups you keep for each game by setting a limit (2 to 100).</li>
					      <li>GBM will keep your backup folder clean by automatically deleting old backups as limits are reached or modified.</li>
					      <li>The Game Manager now allows you to browse and manage ALL backups for each game, not just the latest backup.</li>
				      </ul></li>
				      <li>(All) Using "Monitor Only" no longer puts any limitations on the game configuration or available features.</li>
				      <li>(Windows Installer) The installer will now properly go into upgrade mode if a prior version of GBM is installed. Note: 32-bit and 64-bit qualify as different versions.</li>
				      <li>(Windows Installer) The installer will now create an uninstall entry in Add/Remove Programs (Apps & Features).</li>
