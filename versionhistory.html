            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Any linked process that requires administrator privileges will now ask for elevation when being launched from GBM.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This means GBM no longer needs to be running as administrator to launch these linked processes.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>If GBM quits unexpectedly during a backup operation, such as a power outage or OS shutdown, any incomplete backup operations will be resumed automatically the next time you run the app.</li>
                  <li>The "Play" button on the main form is now disabled for a few seconds after a game launch is triggered.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This prevents attempting to launch a game multiple times by accident.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Fixed a crash that occurs on game detection when GBM cannot access the process details.</li>
                  <li>Fixed the possibility of caching the incorrect icon in some situations.</li>
                  <li>Prevented a confusing error from being shown in the log when an icon can't be cached for expected reasons.</li>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM to unnecessarily require the "Game Path" when detecting a game with a "Monitor Only" configuration.</li>
                  <li>Fixed an issue with the automatic restore feature that could cause restore operations to trigger multiple times when using linked configurations.</li>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM to repeatedly detect the same process if an unexpected error occurred while waiting for that process to end.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The error message will now be displayed in the log and monitoring will be automatically stopped.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The "Last Action" field on the main form now uses the regional setting for "Short Time" instead of being set to a specific format.</li>
                  <li>Fixed the "Limit" field always displaying zero on the Game Manager.</li>
                  <li>Fixed various small issues with the user interface.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>          
            <h3>1.2.5</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Overhauled the user interface.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The "Start-Up Wizard" and "Add Game Wizard" instructions are now easier to read with a larger font.</li>
                      <li>Most buttons in the application are now larger with icons (Thanks to @Darthagnon for help with icons).</li>
                      <li>The redundant "Close" button has been removed from many forms.</li>
                      <li>The "Main Window" now has a collapsible game list with a search filter and quick access to features such backup, restore and game launching.
                        <ul>
                          <li>These new features can be disabled or hidden by default in Settings -> User Interface.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>The "Game Manager" has been slimmed down for ease of use.
                        <ul>
                          <li>The size of the form has been reduced and the sections have been split into tabs.</li>
                          <li>Certain buttons and checkboxes have been moved into sub-menus.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>The "Settings" form has been reorganized into more sections.</li>
                      <li>The "Quick Launch" feature introduced in v1.2.4 has been removed since games can now be launched directly from the main window.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Added the option to detect games using a window title instead of a process name.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This adds another option for detecting games that all run from the same executable. Such as emulated games, browser games, or cloud service games.</li>
                      <li>In addition to the process ending, GBM will also end monitoring when the window title no longer matches the game configuration.</li>
                      <li>This feature is not supported in Linux, see the "Known Issues" section for details.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Added option to show a notification when a backup operation has been completed.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This option is available in the "Backup and Restore" section of the Settings window, it defaults to disabled.</li>
                      <li>A single notification will be shown when a backup operation is completed, even if the operation included multiple games.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Added "Detection Speed" setting.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Allows users monitoring for hundreds or even thousands of games at once to greatly lower CPU usage at the cost of detection speed.</li>
                      <li>The average user with a normal sized game list should never need to adjust this setting, even the "Fast" setting will use very little CPU power every few seconds.</li>
                      <li>This option is available in the "General" section of the Settings window, it defaults to "Fast".</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The "Icon" field now supports the use of Environment and Custom Path variables.</li>
                  <li>The "Search" filter on the Main Window and Game Manager now supports filtering by tag.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Tags must be an exact match.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>AbsolutePath is now a calculated field and no longer stored.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This will break official lists for prior versions of GBM (v1.1.5 - v1.2.4). The last official list(s) compatible with these versions will be archived so they can still be accessed.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Application settings are now handled more efficiently.</li>
                  <li>Added missing code to properly update or delete existing launch data when certain configuration changes are made.</li>
                  <li>Fixed issues with changing the Game ID when that configuration had existing backup files.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows:
                <ul>
                  <li>The icons from game executables are now cached after a session.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The "Main Window" and "Game Manager" will display the cached icon when viewing the game details, unless a custom icon has been set.</li>
                      <li>Cached icons are stored using the PNG format in the GBM temporary folder (can be customized in Settings).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Known Issues (Linux):
                <ul>
                  <li>Detecting games by window title does not work.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Mono hasn't implemented the "MainWindowTitle" property in System.Diagnostics.Process, so this feature is not supported in Linux at this time.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.2.4</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added the ability to launch games.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Games are launched using information GBM has automatically detected or can be fully customized via the Game Manager.
                        <ul>
                          <li>Most games will need to be detected at least once in v1.2.4 or higher before they can be automatically launched using this feature.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>                      
                      <li>Launch any configured game using the "Quick Launcher".
                        <ul>
                          <li>The Quick Launcher is available in the File menu, system tray menu and by using "Ctrl + L" on the main window.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Launch any configured game directly from the Game Manager.</li>
                      <li>Launch the last five games played from the system tray menu.
                        <ul>
                          <li>The "Session Tracking" feature needs to be enabled and have enough recorded data to display any recently played games in the system tray menu.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  <li>Added the ability to customize game launch options.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added "Launch Settings..." button to Game Manager.
                        <ul>
                          <li>Allows the configuration of another launcher (such as Steam) to start the game instead of directly using an executable.
                            <ul>
                              <li>You can manage available launchers using the Launcher Manager. Some popular launchers will be preconfigured.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                        </ul>                        
                      </li>
                      <li>Allows the use of an alternate executable or script.</li>
                      <li>Allows setting alternate launch parameters (or disabling them).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The process path is now always saved once a game has been detected.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Priors versions of GBM only saved the process path when it was required for backup or detection purposes.</li>
                      <li>A warning will now be displayed in the log when the process path cannot be determined.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Session time (and total time played) will now update(once per minute) on the main window, instead of only being displayed after the game ends.</li>              
                  <li>Session time will now be displayed and update(once per minute) on the GBM tray icon tooltip.</li>
                  <li>Disabled features will now have their options removed from all menus. This currently only applies to session tracking and game launching.</li>
                  <li>Fixed issues that prevented configuration save paths from being updated correctly when a custom variable is modified or deleted.</li>
                  <li>Deleting a custom variable will now properly remove the environment variable in the current session and update any affected game configurations.</li>
                  <li>Editing a configuration while using a Custom filter on the Game Manager will no longer lose the changes if any tags are modified before saving.</li>
                  <li>Modifying tags on a single configuration while using a Custom filter on the Game Manager will no longer unselect the current configuration.</li>
                  <li>Any form that asks to save unchanged data on closing, will no longer just close and lose the changes if the form fails validation when choosing to save.</li>
                  <li>Double right-clicking the tray icon no longer triggers "Restore Window".</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows:
                <ul>
                  <li>GBM will no longer crash if the UAC prompt is cancelled while restarting as Administrator.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.2.3</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Improvements to the "Choose Game" window	
                    <ul>
                      <li>It should now always be displayed in front of other windows after closing a game.</li>
                      <li>It now appears in the taskbar, just in case it does get hidden behind other windows.</li>
                      <li>The GBM icon is now displayed on this window.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Improvements to the "Import Game Configurations" window
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added "Show Only Selected" option.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This option will filter the current list to show only currently selected configurations.</li>
                          <li>This option can be combined with the text filter.</li>
                        </ul>                        
                      </li>
                      <li>Added "Detect Saved Games" button.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This button allows you to detect configurations with saved games.  This has always been automatically done when the form is opened, but the button is useful if you need to start over.</li>
                          <li>Using this button will not unselect any configurations you manually selected.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Configurations in an import list that use only a special folder(or custom variable) as the save path, will no longer be incorrectly selected when detecting saved games.
                        <ul>
                          <li>These types of configurations cannot currently be detected, this only fixes them being selected by mistake.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>You can now maximize or minimize this window.</li>
                      <li>Increased the default size of the window.</li>
                      <li>The GBM icon is now displayed on this window and it now appears in the taskbar.</li>
                    </ul>                    
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <li>Windows:
                <ul>
                  <li>Simplified the code used to hide the main window.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Prevents the weird flicker effect that could occur when clicking the close button.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Updated SQLite to 3.33.0</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>            
            <h3>1.2.2</h3>
            <ul>         
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added new settings to customize the UI
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added "Exit when closing main window"
                        <ul>
                          <li>Allows the user to exit the app completely when closing the main window, instead of hiding it.</li>
                          <li>This option defaults to enabled in Linux and disabled in Windows.</li>

                      </li>
                      <li>Added "Exit without confirmation"
                        <ul>
                          <li>Allows the user to exit the app without the confirmation pop-up.</li>
                          <li>This defaults to disabled in both Linux and Windows.</li>

                  <li>Attempted to unify how the UI functions in Windows / Linux and reduce the amount of platform specific work-arounds.
                    <ul>
                      <li>You can now minimize the main window to the taskbar in Windows.</li>

                          <li>The "Show / Hide" option has been replaced by "Restore Window".</li>
                          <li>Double-clicking the tray icon or using "Restore Window" will always restore the app to a normal, visible state and give it focus.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Unfortunately, the main window cannot be hidden in Linux. In cases where it's supposed to be hidden, it will be minimized instead.
                        <ul>
                          <li>Hiding the main window in Linux requires too many work-arounds and my goal was to reduce the amount of platform specific code.</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>Reduced the amount of platform specific code when the app initalizes, this may improve performance.</li>
                  <li>The "Start-Up Wizard" will now always appear in the center of screen, instead of sometimes appearing in a random location.</li>
                  <li>The system tray menu is now disabled during the "Start-Up Wizard".</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed the incorrect save path being stored in the metadata when making backups from games running in Proton / Wine.</li>
                  <li>Moved the wine path detection output into a debug mode instead of cluttering up the log.</li>
                  <li>The Include/Exclude builder on the Game Manager will now properly open to the Proton / Wine saved game path when possible.</li>
                </ul>

                  <li>Added the ability to "link" game configurations.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This allows any linked configuration(s) to automatically run a backup or restore each time their parent is triggered. This can continue in a chain.</li>
                      <li>This feature allows for the proper configuration of rare games that stored their saved games in multiple unique locations. It may also have other creative uses.</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>Metadata is now added to all backup files.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This is a small XML file that contains important information about the archive and the configuration used to make the backup.</li>
                      <li>This allows GBM and possibly any other software to easily identify and use GBM backup files.</li>
                      <li>This file is not extracted when restoring a backup, it will not be cluttering up your saved game folders.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>All backup operations are now performed in a temporary folder before the resulting file is moved to the backup folder.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This change was required to fix periodic issues with cloud software (Dropbox) locking backup files while they were being created.</li>
                      <li>The temporary folder can be manually set in "Settings -> Backup and Restore", it defaults to %LOCALAPPDATA%\gbm (~/.local/share/gbm).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  </li>
                  <li>On startup, GBM now waits up to one minute for the current backup location to become available before displaying an error message.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The error message can now be canceled to continue waiting.</li>
                      <li>This is useful for delayed network shares on startup or if you forgot to plug in an external backup drive.</li>

                  </li>
                  <li>The Game Manager and Custom Variable Manager now use a different folder browser where applicable.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The new browser provides better usability for power users, other areas of the app will still use the classic folder browser.</li>
                      <li>The new browser allows Linux users to "Show Hidden Folders", which can't be done using the classic Folder Browser.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>When a UNC path is used for the backup folder, the disk space check prior to backups will be automatically disabled because it cannot be done.</li>
                  <li>The disk space check prior to backups can now be disabled in the "Backup and Restore" settings.</li>
                  <li>Added "Operating System" field to game configurations:

                  <li>Fixed some inconsistencies with form icons and when forms are shown in the task bar.</li>
                  <li>GBM no longer provides a warning about "Syncing Game IDs" when importing configurations in the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The warning was very confusing and is no longer relevant to most users.</li>
                      <li>The "Sync Game IDs" Tool will continue to be available for now, but the messaging has been changed warning not to use it without reading the manual first.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>You can now set GBM to automatically start on log-in via the "Startup" settings.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This requires that GBM be installed via a package manager or the makefile, so any required files are in a known location.  The option will be disabled otherwise.</li>
                      <li>The "Start Minimized" option is now available in "Startup" settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>GBM now stores all Wine configuration data seperately from the core game configuration:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The core configuration is no longer altered in any way when a game is detected running in Wine or Proton.</li>
                      <li>The Wine configuration data is now automatically updated each time a game is detected, such as when running the game from a new prefix.</li>
                      <li>This data can be viewed and manually modified on the Game Manager.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Fixed the handling of Wine/Proton games when multiple configurations are detected.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a crash when using "Backup Only" and "New Backups Pending" filters on the Game Manager.</li>
                  <li>The Mono and GBM process will now exit cleanly if a critical error occurs during startup.</li>
                  <li>GBM will no longer show the exit dialog when a critical error occurs.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>1.1.7</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that caused the include/exclude builder to crash GBM when a save path contained illegal characters.</li>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that prevented GBM from recording the correct time spent playing a game, when that game was played over consecutive sessions.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.6</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added support for games that save to the Windows %PROGRAMDATA% location.</li>
                  <li>The Game Manager now automatically selects the last detected game when opened.</li>
                  <li>Backup files can no longer be imported into a "Monitor Only" configuration.</li>
                  <li>Optimized the memory and cpu usage of Regular Expressions when monitoring for games.</li>
                  <li>Added a "Recurse sub-folders" option
                    <ul>
                      <li>This option is set per game configuration, it is available on Include/Exclude window of the Game Manager and Add Game Wizard.</li>
                      <li>It is enabled by default on all current and new configurations.</li>
                      <li>Disabling this option prevents 7-Zip and GBM from scanning every sub-folder and file of a save path. This useful when backing up specific files inside an extremely large folder.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Fixed a possible issue with backups when the configuration uses folder path includes.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a memory leak issue with Mono and Regular Expressions.</li>
                  <li>Fixed some issues when detecting the prefix of Wine/Proton games.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The default prefix (~/.wine) will be assumed when a detected game does not have the WINEPREFIX variable set.</li>
                      <li>A prefix can now be fully detected when it contains spaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Windows configurations that use a relative save path are now properly converted when detected in Wine/Proton.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>            
            <h3>1.1.5</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a crash that could occur when renaming a game configuration.</li>
                  <li>Rewrote portions of game detection:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The handling of duplicate game configurations has been flawed since regular expression support was added in v1.1. This has been fixed.</li>
                      <li>GBM is now more efficient when detecting games by parameter and/or process path.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Changed how save path variables are handled:
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM no longer uses it's own format and naming scheme for path variables.</li>
                      <li>GBM now uses Windows environment variables in game configurations.
                        <ul>
                          <li>For example, *appdatalocal* is now %LOCALAPPDATA% in a Windows configuration.</li>
                          <li>GBM also uses some custom environment variables, such as %USERDOCUMENTS% and %COMMONDOCUMENTS%. These are needed for compatability and to handle some limitations with how GBM interacts with 7-Zip.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>GBM now uses the XDG specification for game configurations in Linux. (Thanks basxto!)
                        <ul>
                          <li>For example, *appdatalocal* is now ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share} in a Linux configuration.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Custom Path Variables have changed. For example, *Steam User Data* will now be %Steam User Data%.
                        <ul>
                          <li>They will appear this way in Windows and Linux.</li>
                          <li>GBM will no longer allows the creation of variables using reserved names, such as APPDATA.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Your configurations will be automatically updated to these new formats when upgrading to v1.1.5.</li>
                      <li>These changes will break game list compatability with other versions of GBM. Archived lists are available at <a href="http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/archive.html">http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/archive.html</a> for those that wish to stay on an older version.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added a new setting, "Show resolved save paths in Game Manager".
                    <ul>
                      <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                      <li>When enabled, GBM will display resolved save paths in the Game Manager. This is how GBM displayed paths prior to v1.1.5.</li>
                      <li>When disabled, GBM will display save paths with their variables when applicable.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added a tooltip to applicable "Path" fields on the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This tooltip either displays either a resolved or unresolved path.</li>
                      <li>The behaviour is toggled by the "Show resolved save paths" setting.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added "Import Backup Files" feature to the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This feature allows you to import one or more backup files for a specific game configuration.</li>
                      <li>This is useful if you lost your GBM database(s), but not the backup files. It also can be used to easily move compatible saved game backups between Windows and Linux.</li>
                      <li>GBM cannot verify that the backups being imported are compatible with the current configuration. This is up to the user!</li>
                      <li>This feature will be expanded and refined in future releases.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that prevented Wine / Proton games from being detected in some cases.</li>
                  <li>GBM can now use any Windows configuration to detect and backup games running in Wine / Proton.
                    <ul>
                      <li>An absolute Windows save path, such "%APPDATA%\Game\Saved Games" will be automatically converted to the proper path within the detected Wine prefix.</li>
                      <li>The converted path will be saved to the configuration once game has been detected at least once.</li>
                      <li>You cannot restore a backup using an absolute Windows path. The game needs to be detected at least once so the correct save path can be determined.</li>
                      <li>This feature should be considered "Beta" and may not work in all scenarios. Please report any issues you may encounter!</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>

              <li>Website:
                <ul>
                  <li>Search features have been added to the Official Game Lists (Thanks basxto!)
                    <ul>
                      <li>Includes advanced features such as searching by tag and excludes.</li>
                      <li>Tags are now clickable for automatic searching of similar games.</li>
                      <li>Searches are linkable.</li>
                      <li>You can now link directly to a single configuration using the new link icon.</li>
                      <li>Configurations intelligently collapse or uncollapse based on search results.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Changed method of handling required OS environment paths and added a new path check on startup.</li>
                  <li>Incorrect conflict warnings will no longer be shown in some situations when running a backup configuration with "Save Multiple Backups" enabled.</li>
                  <li>Fixed the precision of "Total Hours" on the Session Viewer, it now always rounds to 2 decimal places.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows:
                  <ul>
                    <li>GBM will no longer keep an open file handle on detected processes and custom icons.</li>

              <li>Linux:
                  <ul>
                  <li>Sorting by "Hours" in the Session Viewer will no longer crash GBM on certain systems.</li>
                  <li>GBM no longer attempts to get icons from a Linux binary.</li>
                  <li>Removed compression from GBM icon to prevent issues with recent versions of imagemagick.</li>
                  </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms
                <ul>
                    <li>Game tags are now sorted alphanumerically on the Game Manager and in XML exports.</li>
                    <li>GBM now displays a unique backup overwrite warning for games that use a relative saved game path.</li>
                    <li>The "Save Multiple Backups" setting now allows infinite backups when "Backup Limit" is set to 0. This is now the default for new configurations.</li>
                    <li>"Save Multiple Backups" and "Backup Limit" are now core fields, they are synced by default and included in the Import/Export.</li>
                    <li>The Game Manager will now clean up it's own manifest when backup files are deleted outside of GBM. As to not affect performance, this only occurs when the "Backup Data" field is accessed.</li>
                    <li>When a single game is selected, the Game Manager now restores the currently selected backup, instead of always restoring the latest backup.</li>
                    <li>If possible, GBM now displays the full path of the detected process when multiple configurations are triggered.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that could cause certain controls to become enabled incorrectly on the Game Manager.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM not to remove empty sub-folders unless the "Use Game ID for files and folders" setting was enabled when the folder was created.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM not to rename backup files or sub-folders unless the "Use Game ID for files and folders" setting was enabled.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM to only rename the most current backup file when modifying a Name or Game ID.</li>
                    <li>GBM no longer displays a sync warning when the user deletes all game configurations from the Game Manager.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Modified "Quick Filter" behavior on the Game Manager.
                      <ul>
                        <li>The game list now becomes disabled when typing in the Quick Filter and enabled only when the filter has finished running.</li>
                        <li>When using the Quick Filter, the currently selected game will be automatically deselected.</li>
                        <li>These changes prevent the Game Manager from entering an unstable state after using the Quick Filter.</li>
                      </ul>

              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Spelling error fixed in manual backup message</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>1.1.0</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Core Design Changes (Game Configuration)
                    <ul>
                      <li>Game ID is now exposed to the user and can be changed.  This feature is mainly for developer and contributer usage.</li>
                      <li>Game ID is generated automatically by GBM or acquired from an import, the user doesn't need to set it unless they want to.</li>
                      <li>Game ID (instead of Game Name) can now be used to name backup files and folders.
                        <ul>
                          <li>GBM will continue to use the name by default for ease of use.</li>
                          <li>This behavior can be toggled in the "Backup and Restore" section of Settings.</li>
                          <li>Using the game Name for backup files has a minor risk associated with it. See "Known Issue #2 and #4" for more details.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Game Name can now contain any character.</li>
                      <li>When a game is deleted via Game Manager (or sync), all backup manifest entries for that particular game are now deleted. The backup files themselves are not.</li>
                      <li>The Game Manager now syncs changes to the remote database immediately, instead of only when closed.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Feature Additions &amp; Changes
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added Regular Expression support for game detection.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This feature allows GBM to detect games based on a pattern instead of a single process name.</li>
                          <li>This allows GBM to better support games that run from multiple executables and games that use interpreters or emulators.</li>
                          <li>Use the new "Regular Expression" checkbox on the Game Manager and enter the pattern in the "Process" field.</li>
                          <li>GBM will validate patterns and offer to help troubleshoot (using regexr.com) when validation fails.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added the ability to start another process (or multiple processes) whenever a game is detected.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is useful to automatically start utilities, such as custom control schemes or overlays when a specific game is detected.</li>
                          <li>The "Process Manager" allows you to manage any programs you'd like to launch.</li>
                          <li>The "Processes..." button on the Game Manager allows you to assign processes to any selected game.</li>
                          <li>A process can be set to end when the game is closed.</li>
                          <li>Processes and related settings are specific to the local machine only.  They are not synced to the backup folder and are not part of the import/export.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added "Backup GBM data files on launch" to the settings.  A long overdue feature, this will backup both the remote and local databases (as gbm.s3db.launch.bak) each time GBM starts.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                          <li>Only one backup is kept, the prior one will be overwritten.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added the ability to display messages or warnings that can be suppressed after one view.  These messages can be reset via the Settings screen.</li>
                      <li>The "Enable Sync" feature is now mandatory and the option been removed from Settings.</li>
                      <li>The "Clean Local Manifest" feature has been removed.  It is not required because manfiest entries are no longer orphaned by design.  Existing orphaned entries will be removed during the v1.1.0 database upgrade.</li>
                      <li>Added "Sync Game IDs" feature.  This allows the user to update their game configuration identifiers to match the official list or an export file.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is mainly an optional upgrade tool for users with existing data from older versions.  It allows the import feature to properly recognize and update game configurations.</li>
                          <li>The sync is based on similarly named game configurations, therefore it's not 100% effective.  Some games may be missed and require manual changes.</li>
                          <li>If you share a backup folder with multiple PCs, this feature will cause some data loss when the new IDs are synced to the other PCs.  See "Known Issue #1"</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added "Disable sync event messages" to the settings.  This will remove all sync related information messages in the log.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                          <li>Sync messages can cause a lot of useless clutter in the log and are not useful to most users.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Re-organized the Setting screen to clear up some space for the future.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Import / Export Changes
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM now uses the Game ID to determine if a game is new or has an updated configuration.</li>
                      <li>GBM will offer to "Sync Game IDs" when importing from the official list after upgrading to v1.1.0.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This allows the import to recognize and update your configurations from older versions.</li>
                          <li>This offer only appears once and only appears for users that have upgraded from an older version.	</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added icons to the import list to indicate a "New" or "Updated" game.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Updated session CSV export to adhere to RFC 4180.  It now handles commas, quotes and line breaks correctly.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>Updated 7-Zip to v18.01</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>GBM now uses notify-send (libnotify) if it's available to display notifications on Linux.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Mono style notifications will be displayed if notify-send is not available.</li>
                      <li>The GBM icon will be displayed on notifications if it's been installed via the makefile or a package installer.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Known Issues:
                <ol>
                  <li>If one or more Game IDs are changed (manually or via Game ID Sync) on one computer and these changes are synced to another PC sharing the same backup folder, the following data will be lost.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The local session data on that PC for the changed game(s) will be lost.</li>
                      <li>The local backup manifest data for the changed game(s) on that PC will be lost.  GBM will see any backups for the changed game(s) as new and will handle them accordingly.</li>
                      <li>Any processes assigned to the changed games(s) on that PC will be lost.</li>
                      <li>Once your PCs are back in sync, this will no longer be an issue unless you are constantly changing your Game IDs, which is not recommended.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Backup files are not being renamed or removed when a new backup is created.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This happens on the first backup after toggling between using the Name or ID for your file names.  It's best to choose one setting and stick with it.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>The error "The requested operation requires elevation" occurs when GBM tries to launch a process associated with a game.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This means the process you're trying to launch with GBM requires administrator privilege.</li>
                      <li>Click the blue "user" icon on the bottom left of the GBM window to quickly switch to administrator mode.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Game configurations using the same name, and configurations that end up with the same name when special characters are stripped will overwrite each other's backup files.
                    <ul>
                      <li>For most users this should be a non-issue.  Toggle "Use Game ID for folder and file names" to on in the Settings screen if this is a problem for you.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Important Notices:
                <ol>
                  <li>Configurations on the official game lists are no longer compatible with older GBM versions.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Configurations can now use Regular Expressions to detect when a game is running, which old versions of GBM will not understand how to handle.</li>
                      <li>Configurations can now use any character in the game name, which may cause backups to fail in old versions of GBM.</li>
                      <li>The last official lists compatible with v1.0.7 and prior versions are <a href="archive.html">archived and available to download</a> from the GBM website for users who wish to stay on an older version.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>

                      <li>The recording of short sessions can now be ignored using a setting.</li>
                    </ul></li>                  
                  <li>Changed setting "Backup only when session time exceeds XX minutes" to "Ignore sessions shorter than XX minutes".
                    <ul>

                  <li>(Linux) Please note that Wine detection is still handled automatically by GBM and only requires a Windows process name.  But this feature does work with Wine if you need to detect parameters!</li>
                </ul></li>	            
              <li>(All) Added the ability to resize and maximize the main program window.

            </ul>
            <h3>1.0.1</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>(All) Added features to automatically handle new backup files.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>This option is used for games that change the file names of their saves, which results in a mix of old and new saved games if the old saves aren't deleted first.</li>
                <li>This option has limitations and is not part of official configurations or import/export features.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>(All) The "Verify backup files with a checksum" option has been removed. This feature is now baked into GBM and cannot be disabled.</li>

					      <li>You can limit the amount of backups you keep for each game by setting a limit (2 to 100).</li>
					      <li>GBM will keep your backup folder clean by automatically deleting old backups as limits are reached or modified.</li>
					      <li>The Game Manager now allows you to browse and manage ALL backups for each game, not just the latest backup.</li>
				      </ul></li>
				      <li>(All) Using "Monitor Only" no longer puts any limitations on the game configuration or available features.</li>
				      <li>(Windows Installer) The installer will now properly go into upgrade mode if a prior version of GBM is installed. Note: 32-bit and 64-bit qualify as different versions.</li>
				      <li>(Windows Installer) The installer will now create an uninstall entry in Add/Remove Programs (Apps & Features).</li>
