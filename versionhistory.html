              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Custom Path Variables and certain Environment Variables are now supported in the "Game Path" field.</li>
                  <li>Fixed multiple crash issues caused by a custom icon being an invalid image format.</li>
                  <li>GBM now uses UTC date/time for the build identifier.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.9</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a bug on the Game Manager that caused the "Save Entire Folder" checkbox to be unchecked anytime the "Save Path" field was changed.</li>
                  <li>The "Add Game Wizard" now allows you to set an unlimited number of backups.</li>
                  <li>The "Backup Limit" label has been updated to indicate that 0 means unlimited.</li>
                  <li>The "Open Backup File" button on the Game Manager is now called "Open Backup". It now gives a choice between opening the backup file or the folder containing the file.</li>
                  <li>Set rules are now used for backup folder and file names, regardless of the operating system GBM is running on.
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM now always filters out NTFS reserved characters and allows a maximum file name length of 255.</li>
                      <li>This will prevent various problems when using a backup drive with a non-standard file system in Linux or Windows.</li>
                      <li>These rules will be applied to new backup files or folders, existing backups not be modified.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Made improvements to the Start-Up Wizard.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The default backup location now includes a "Game Backup Monitor" sub-folder.</li>
                      <li>The wizard will now automatically create the backup location if it doesn't exist.</li>
                      <li>You can no longer attempt to Import Backup Files during the Start-Up Wizard.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a bug that caused the "Available Disk Space" check to fail if the backup folder contained one or more spaces.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.8</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added the ability to backup and restore saved games that are stored in the Windows registry:
                    <ul>
                      <li>This feature is also supported in Linux for Windows games running in Wine/Proton.</li>
                      <li>Please see the <a href="http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/manual.html#registry">online manual</a> for more details on how to use this feature.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>On startup, GBM now waits up to one minute for the current backup location to become available before displaying an error message.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The error message can now be canceled to continue waiting.</li>
                      <li>This is useful for delayed network shares on startup or if you forgot to plug in an external backup drive.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The "Choose Game" window now displays tags in addition to the game name when multiple configurations are detected.</li>
                  <li>The "Backup Confirmation" window should now always get top focus after a gaming session ends.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This fix has also been applied to other important messages to make sure they don't get hidden behind other windows.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The Game Manager and Custom Variable Manager now use a different folder browser where applicable.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The new browser provides better usability for power users, other areas of the app will still use the classic folder browser.</li>
                      <li>The new browser allows Linux users to "Show Hidden Folders", which can't be done using the classic Folder Browser.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>When a UNC path is used for the backup folder, the disk space check prior to backups will be automatically disabled because it cannot be done.</li>
                  <li>The disk space check prior to backups can now be disabled in the "Backup and Restore" settings.</li>
                  <li>Added "Operating System" field to game configurations:
                    <ul>
                      <li>"Windows" and "Linux" are the only valid choices at this time and only Linux users are allowed to change this field.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Changed how GBM initilizes on startup to fix some long standing issues.</li>
                  <li>Fixed some inconsistencies with form icons and when forms are shown in the task bar.</li>
                  <li>GBM no longer provides a warning about "Syncing Game IDs" when importing configurations in the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The warning was very confusing and is no longer relevant to most users.</li>
                      <li>The "Sync Game IDs" Tool will continue to be available for now, but the messaging has been changed warning not to use it without reading the manual first.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>        
              <li>Windows:
                <ul>
                  <li>Updated SQLite to 3.27.2</li>
                  <li>Updated 7-Zip to 19.00</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>You can now set GBM to automatically start on log-in via the "Startup" settings.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This requires that GBM be installed via a package manager or the makefile, so any required files are in a known location.  The option will be disabled otherwise.</li>
                      <li>The "Start Minimized" option is now available in "Startup" settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>GBM now stores all Wine configuration data seperately from the core game configuration:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The core configuration is no longer altered in any way when a game is detected running in Wine or Proton.</li>
                      <li>The Wine configuration data is now automatically updated each time a game is detected, such as when running the game from a new prefix.</li>
                      <li>This data can be viewed and manually modified on the Game Manager.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Fixed the handling of Wine/Proton games when multiple configurations are detected.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a crash when using "Backup Only" and "New Backups Pending" filters on the Game Manager.</li>
                  <li>The Mono and GBM process will now exit cleanly if a critical error occurs during startup.</li>
                  <li>GBM will no longer show the exit dialog when a critical error occurs.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.7</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that caused the include/exclude builder to crash GBM when a save path contained illegal characters.</li>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that prevented GBM from recording the correct time spent playing a game, when that game was played over consecutive sessions.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>1.1.6</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added support for games that save to the Windows %PROGRAMDATA% location.</li>
                  <li>The Game Manager now automatically selects the last detected game when opened.</li>
                  <li>Backup files can no longer be imported into a "Monitor Only" configuration.</li>
                  <li>Optimized the memory and cpu usage of Regular Expressions when monitoring for games.</li>
                  <li>Added a "Recurse sub-folders" option
                    <ul>
                      <li>This option is set per game configuration, it is available on Include/Exclude window of the Game Manager and Add Game Wizard.</li>
                      <li>It is enabled by default on all current and new configurations.</li>
                      <li>Disabling this option prevents 7-Zip and GBM from scanning every sub-folder and file of a save path. This useful when backing up specific files inside an extremely large folder.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Fixed a possible issue with backups when the configuration uses folder path includes.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a memory leak issue with Mono and Regular Expressions.</li>
                  <li>Fixed some issues when detecting the prefix of Wine/Proton games.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The default prefix (~/.wine) will be assumed when a detected game does not have the WINEPREFIX variable set.</li>
                      <li>A prefix can now be fully detected when it contains spaces.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Windows configurations that use a relative save path are now properly converted when detected in Wine/Proton.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>            
            <h3>1.1.5</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a crash that could occur when renaming a game configuration.</li>
                  <li>Rewrote portions of game detection:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The handling of duplicate game configurations has been flawed since regular expression support was added in v1.1. This has been fixed.</li>
                      <li>GBM is now more efficient when detecting games by parameter and/or process path.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Changed how save path variables are handled:
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM no longer uses it's own format and naming scheme for path variables.</li>
                      <li>GBM now uses Windows environment variables in game configurations.
                        <ul>
                          <li>For example, *appdatalocal* is now %LOCALAPPDATA% in a Windows configuration.</li>
                          <li>GBM also uses some custom environment variables, such as %USERDOCUMENTS% and %COMMONDOCUMENTS%. These are needed for compatability and to handle some limitations with how GBM interacts with 7-Zip.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>GBM now uses the XDG specification for game configurations in Linux. (Thanks basxto!)
                        <ul>
                          <li>For example, *appdatalocal* is now ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share} in a Linux configuration.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Custom Path Variables have changed. For example, *Steam User Data* will now be %Steam User Data%.
                        <ul>
                          <li>They will appear this way in Windows and Linux.</li>
                          <li>GBM will no longer allows the creation of variables using reserved names, such as APPDATA.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Your configurations will be automatically updated to these new formats when upgrading to v1.1.5.</li>
                      <li>These changes will break game list compatability with other versions of GBM. Archived lists are available at <a href="http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/archive.html">http://mikemaximus.github.io/gbm-web/archive.html</a> for those that wish to stay on an older version.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added a new setting, "Show resolved save paths in Game Manager".
                    <ul>
                      <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                      <li>When enabled, GBM will display resolved save paths in the Game Manager. This is how GBM displayed paths prior to v1.1.5.</li>
                      <li>When disabled, GBM will display save paths with their variables when applicable.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added a tooltip to applicable "Path" fields on the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This tooltip either displays either a resolved or unresolved path.</li>
                      <li>The behaviour is toggled by the "Show resolved save paths" setting.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Added "Import Backup Files" feature to the Game Manager.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This feature allows you to import one or more backup files for a specific game configuration.</li>
                      <li>This is useful if you lost your GBM database(s), but not the backup files. It also can be used to easily move compatible saved game backups between Windows and Linux.</li>
                      <li>GBM cannot verify that the backups being imported are compatible with the current configuration. This is up to the user!</li>
                      <li>This feature will be expanded and refined in future releases.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed an issue that prevented Wine / Proton games from being detected in some cases.</li>
                  <li>GBM can now use any Windows configuration to detect and backup games running in Wine / Proton.
                    <ul>
                      <li>An absolute Windows save path, such "%APPDATA%\Game\Saved Games" will be automatically converted to the proper path within the detected Wine prefix.</li>
                      <li>The converted path will be saved to the configuration once game has been detected at least once.</li>
                      <li>You cannot restore a backup using an absolute Windows path. The game needs to be detected at least once so the correct save path can be determined.</li>
                      <li>This feature should be considered "Beta" and may not work in all scenarios. Please report any issues you may encounter!</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Website:
                <ul>
                  <li>Search features have been added to the Official Game Lists (Thanks basxto!)
                    <ul>
                      <li>Includes advanced features such as searching by tag and excludes.</li>
                      <li>Tags are now clickable for automatic searching of similar games.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Changed method of handling required OS environment paths and added a new path check on startup.</li>
                  <li>Incorrect conflict warnings will no longer be shown in some situations when running a backup configuration with "Save Multiple Backups" enabled.</li>
                  <li>Fixed the precision of "Total Hours" on the Session Viewer, it now always rounds to 2 decimal places.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Game tags are now sorted alphanumerically on the Game Manager and in XML exports.</li>
                    <li>GBM now displays a unique backup overwrite warning for games that use a relative saved game path.</li>
                    <li>The "Save Multiple Backups" setting now allows infinite backups when "Backup Limit" is set to 0. This is now the default for new configurations.</li>
                    <li>"Save Multiple Backups" and "Backup Limit" are now core fields, they are synced by default and included in the Import/Export.</li>
                    <li>The Game Manager will now clean up it's own manifest when backup files are deleted outside of GBM. As to not affect performance, this only occurs when the "Backup Data" field is accessed.</li>
                    <li>When a single game is selected, the Game Manager now restores the currently selected backup, instead of always restoring the latest backup.</li>
                    <li>If possible, GBM now displays the full path of the detected process when multiple configurations are triggered.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that could cause certain controls to become enabled incorrectly on the Game Manager.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM not to remove empty sub-folders unless the "Use Game ID for files and folders" setting was enabled when the folder was created.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM not to rename backup files or sub-folders unless the "Use Game ID for files and folders" setting was enabled.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an issue that caused GBM to only rename the most current backup file when modifying a Name or Game ID.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Modified "Quick Filter" behavior on the Game Manager.
                      <ul>
                        <li>The game list now becomes disabled when typing in the Quick Filter and enabled only when the filter has finished running.</li>
                        <li>When using the Quick Filter, the currently selected game will be automatically deselected.</li>
                        <li>These changes prevent the Game Manager from entering an unstable state after using the Quick Filter.</li>

            <h3>1.1.0</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All Platforms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Core Design Changes (Game Configuration)
                    <ul>
                      <li>Game ID is now exposed to the user and can be changed.  This feature is mainly for developer and contributer usage.</li>
                      <li>Game ID is generated automatically by GBM or acquired from an import, the user doesn't need to set it unless they want to.</li>
                      <li>Game ID (instead of Game Name) can now be used to name backup files and folders.
                        <ul>
                          <li>GBM will continue to use the name by default for ease of use.</li>
                          <li>This behavior can be toggled in the "Backup and Restore" section of Settings.</li>
                          <li>Using the game Name for backup files has a minor risk associated with it. See "Known Issue #2 and #4" for more details.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Game Name can now contain any character.</li>
                      <li>When a game is deleted via Game Manager (or sync), all backup manifest entries for that particular game are now deleted. The backup files themselves are not.</li>
                      <li>The Game Manager now syncs changes to the remote database immediately, instead of only when closed.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Feature Additions &amp; Changes
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added Regular Expression support for game detection.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This feature allows GBM to detect games based on a pattern instead of a single process name.</li>
                          <li>This allows GBM to better support games that run from multiple executables and games that use interpreters or emulators.</li>
                          <li>Use the new "Regular Expression" checkbox on the Game Manager and enter the pattern in the "Process" field.</li>
                          <li>GBM will validate patterns and offer to help troubleshoot (using regexr.com) when validation fails.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added the ability to start another process (or multiple processes) whenever a game is detected.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is useful to automatically start utilities, such as custom control schemes or overlays when a specific game is detected.</li>
                          <li>The "Process Manager" allows you to manage any programs you'd like to launch.</li>
                          <li>The "Processes..." button on the Game Manager allows you to assign processes to any selected game.</li>
                          <li>A process can be set to end when the game is closed.</li>
                          <li>Processes and related settings are specific to the local machine only.  They are not synced to the backup folder and are not part of the import/export.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added "Backup GBM data files on launch" to the settings.  A long overdue feature, this will backup both the remote and local databases (as gbm.s3db.launch.bak) each time GBM starts.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                          <li>Only one backup is kept, the prior one will be overwritten.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added the ability to display messages or warnings that can be suppressed after one view.  These messages can be reset via the Settings screen.</li>
                      <li>The "Enable Sync" feature is now mandatory and the option been removed from Settings.</li>
                      <li>The "Clean Local Manifest" feature has been removed.  It is not required because manfiest entries are no longer orphaned by design.  Existing orphaned entries will be removed during the v1.1.0 database upgrade.</li>
                      <li>Added "Sync Game IDs" feature.  This allows the user to update their game configuration identifiers to match the official list or an export file.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is mainly an optional upgrade tool for users with existing data from older versions.  It allows the import feature to properly recognize and update game configurations.</li>
                          <li>The sync is based on similarly named game configurations, therefore it's not 100% effective.  Some games may be missed and require manual changes.</li>
                          <li>If you share a backup folder with multiple PCs, this feature will cause some data loss when the new IDs are synced to the other PCs.  See "Known Issue #1"</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added "Disable sync event messages" to the settings.  This will remove all sync related information messages in the log.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This new setting is enabled by default.</li>
                          <li>Sync messages can cause a lot of useless clutter in the log and are not useful to most users.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Re-organized the Setting screen to clear up some space for the future.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Import / Export Changes
                    <ul>
                      <li>GBM now uses the Game ID to determine if a game is new or has an updated configuration.</li>
                      <li>GBM will offer to "Sync Game IDs" when importing from the official list after upgrading to v1.1.0.
                        <ul>
                          <li>This allows the import to recognize and update your configurations from older versions.</li>
                          <li>This offer only appears once and only appears for users that have upgraded from an older version.	</li>
                        </ul></li>
                      <li>Added icons to the import list to indicate a "New" or "Updated" game.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Updated session CSV export to adhere to RFC 4180.  It now handles commas, quotes and line breaks correctly.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Windows Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>Updated 7-Zip to v18.01</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Linux Only:
                <ul>
                  <li>GBM now uses notify-send (libnotify) if it's available to display notifications on Linux.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Mono style notifications will be displayed if notify-send is not available.</li>
                      <li>The GBM icon will be displayed on notifications if it's been installed via the makefile or a package installer.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Known Issues:
                <ol>
                  <li>If one or more Game IDs are changed (manually or via Game ID Sync) on one computer and these changes are synced to another PC sharing the same backup folder, the following data will be lost.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The local session data on that PC for the changed game(s) will be lost.</li>
                      <li>The local backup manifest data for the changed game(s) on that PC will be lost.  GBM will see any backups for the changed game(s) as new and will handle them accordingly.</li>
                      <li>Any processes assigned to the changed games(s) on that PC will be lost.</li>
                      <li>Once your PCs are back in sync, this will no longer be an issue unless you are constantly changing your Game IDs, which is not recommended.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Backup files are not being renamed or removed when a new backup is created.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This happens on the first backup after toggling between using the Name or ID for your file names.  It's best to choose one setting and stick with it.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>The error "The requested operation requires elevation" occurs when GBM tries to launch a process associated with a game.
                    <ul>
                      <li>This means the process you're trying to launch with GBM requires administrator privilege.</li>
                      <li>Click the blue "user" icon on the bottom left of the GBM window to quickly switch to administrator mode.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                  <li>Game configurations using the same name, and configurations that end up with the same name when special characters are stripped will overwrite each other's backup files.
                    <ul>
                      <li>For most users this should be a non-issue.  Toggle "Use Game ID for folder and file names" to on in the Settings screen if this is a problem for you.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Important Notices:
                <ol>
                  <li>Configurations on the official game lists are no longer compatible with older GBM versions.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Configurations can now use Regular Expressions to detect when a game is running, which old versions of GBM will not understand how to handle.</li>
                      <li>Configurations can now use any character in the game name, which may cause backups to fail in old versions of GBM.</li>
                      <li>The last official lists compatible with v1.0.7 and prior versions are <a href="archive.html">archived and available to download</a> from the GBM website for users who wish to stay on an older version.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
              </li>

                      <li>Fixed issues with date sorting, it will now sort correctly regardless of format.</li>
                      <li>The recording of short sessions can now be ignored using a setting.</li>
                    </ul></li>                  
                  <li>Changed setting "Backup only when session time exceeds XX minutes" to "Ignore sessions shorter than XX minutes".
                    <ul>
                      <li>This setting is now used to ignore recording sessions times (when enabled) in addition to ignoring a backup.</li>

              <li>Fixed a critical bug with the Game Manager which allowed you to add duplicate entries. This resulted in a crash and the inability start the app again. 0.81 fixes this bug and will repair any database broken by this issue so the app will function again. (Thanks Nirth from GOG.com)</li>
              <li>Fixed an annoying bug where extra game data was being lost when syncing hours spent between computers.</li>
              <li>Fixed a potential issue with changing the backup folder.</li>

              <li>Automatic syncing of game list and applicable extra data (such as Hours played) between computers sharing the same backup folder. See "Notes on Automatic Syncing" in the manual.</li>
