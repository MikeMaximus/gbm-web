            <p>The next version (v0.95) is under development.</p>
	   		<h3>New in 0.95</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/issues?q=label%3Abug+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Av0.95">Bug Fixes</a></li>
                            <li>The "Check for new backups" feature has been renamed and redesigned.  Instead of an annoying pop-up, it now shows a simple notification in the main menu or tray menu.</li>
                            <li>Added the ability to trigger backups only after a certain session time has elapsed (Global Setting), this setting will be disabled by default.</li>
                            <li>You can now cancel out of the "Choose Game" window when GBM detects multiple games may be running.</li>                            
                            <li>Many UI improvements and fixes with filtering, such as the ability to filter by games with no tags.</li>
                            <li>Added ability to filter by game name or process.</li>
                            <li>Updated the "Add Game Wizard" to use the new include / exclude and tagging features .</li>                            
                            <li>Removed the special handling of DOSBox games for future proofing, DOSBox games will now be handled like all other games.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Due to this change, GBM will only detect DOS games that are using their own copy of DOSBox in a unique location.  Classic games sold online are already pre-packaged in this format.</li>
                                    <li>This change will break your current DOSBox game configurations and GBM can not reliably update them automatically.  Sorry for the inconvience.</li>
                                    <li>To repair a configuration, you'll need to delete the DOS executable part of the process field and make sure the case matches the DOSBox executable being used by the game.</li>
                                    <li>For example, Capitalism Plus using a process of "dosbox:CAPPLUS" and DOSBox.exe would become just "DOSBox".</li>
                                    <li>All available official configurations for DOSBox games will be updated and ready for the v0.95 release.</li>
                                </ul></li>
                            <li>Added a new, intuitive way of including and excluding items in a backup.  A preview is below.<br /><br /><img class="centered" src="images/screens/v95_preview.jpg" width="586" height="488" alt="Preview" /></li>                            
                        </ul>
