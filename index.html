            <p>The next version (v0.95) is under development.</p>
	   		<h3>New in 0.95</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/MikeMaximus/gbm/issues?q=label%3Abug+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Av0.95">Bug Fixes</a></li>
                            <li>Fixed a regression that caused non-critical fields (Game Path, Company, Version, Icon, Enabled, Monitor Only) to be wiped or reset on sync.</li>
                            <li>The "Check for new backups" feature has been renamed and redesigned.  Instead of an annoying pop-up, it now shows a simple notification in the main menu or tray menu.</li>
                            <li>Added the ability to trigger backups only after a certain session time has elapsed (Global Setting), this setting will be disabled by default.</li>
                            <li>You can now cancel out of the "Choose Game" window when GBM detects multiple games may be running.</li>
                            <li>Added the ability to filter by game information such as name, process and company.</li>
                            <li>Many UI improvements and fixes with filtering, such as the ability to filter by games with no tags. The "Tag" filter is now called "Custom" filter, due to the new options available.</li>                            
                            <li>Updated the "Add Game Wizard" to use the new include / exclude and tagging features.</li>
                            <li>Removed the special handling of DOSBox games for future proofing, DOSBox games will now be handled like all other games.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Due to this change, GBM will only detect DOS games that are using their own copy of DOSBox in a unique location.  Classic games sold online are already packaged in this format.</li>
                                    <li>This change WILL break all your current DOSBox game configurations and GBM can not reliably update them automatically.  Sorry for the inconvience.</li>
                                    <li>To repair a configuration, you'll need to delete the DOS executable part of the process field and make sure the case matches the DOSBox executable being used by the game.  You can use the new "Custom" filter to easily find and update all your DOSBox games.</li>
                                    <li>For example, Capitalism Plus using a process of "dosbox:CAPPLUS" and DOSBox.exe would become just "DOSBox".</li>                                    
                                    <li>All available official configurations for DOSBox games will be updated and ready for the v0.95 release.</li>
                                </ul></li>
                            <li>Moved the import and export game list features from the Tools menu into the Game Manager.</li>
                            <li>Made some updates to the main app window.  It looks a little less clunky!<br /><br /><img class="centered" src="images/screens/v95_preview_02.jpg" width="526" height="238" alt="Preview #1" /></li>
                            <li>Added a new, intuitive way of including and excluding items in a backup.  A preview is below.<br /><br /><img class="centered" src="images/screens/v95_preview.jpg" width="586" height="488" alt="Preview #2" /></li>
                        </ul>
