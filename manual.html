				<div id="pageSectionContent">
					<p>Game Backup Monitor is a Windows system tray application that automatically detects games as you play them. When you're finished playing, a compressed backup of the save data will be automatically created in a location you've specified, such as a cloud folder, network folder or external drive.</p>
					<p>If you use Game Backup Monitor on multiple computers and share the same backup folder, you can effectively add cloud save support to any game or application.  GBM can notify you of new save games to be restored when you move to each computer.</p>
					<p>Game Backup Monitor was designed with classic DRM-free gaming in mind,  but it can be used to monitor any application on your PC!</p>
					<h3>Game Backup Monitor is completely free and open source software.</h3>
					<h4>Game Backup Monitor is currently only available in English.</h4>

					<p>When the Start-up Wizard appears read the instructions and follow along.</p>

					<p>You'll need to set a backup folder in which GBM will store all game backups, as well as single data file (gbm.s3db) for tracking and syncing.</p>

					<p>If you're planning to use GBM to sync save games between multiple computers this can be set to a cloud folder, network folder, or even a folder on a thumb drive.  All computers you're planning to use should be set to this folder in the wizard.</p>

					<p>GBM needs to know which games you want to monitor for and how to handle them.  The Start-Up Wizard will allow you to download game configurations of your choosing from the official list (work in progress), or set them up yourself via the Add Game Wizard or Game Manager.</p>

					<p>Once you have a list of games setup the work is done!  GBM will now monitor for each game and run a backup when it's completed.</p>

					<p>GBM is setup to be verbose by default.  If you want it to run silently in the background, you can configure that in the "File -> Setup" screen.</p>

							<div id="pageSectionContent">
								<p>The main GBM window is mostly for information display, but has some important functions.</p>
								<p>The core portion of the window displays information about any game that has been detected, or information about a backup or restore operation currently being performed.</p>
								<p>You can view a detailed log of all the actions GBM has performed in the current session by clicking "Show Log".</p>
								<p>The status bar shows what GBM is currently doing, as well as the monitor status.</p>
								<p>The monitor status button can be used to control starting, stopping and cancelling game detection.  This can also be accomplished with the File menu and system tray menu.</p>
								<p>A "Cancel" button will appear on the main window during backup & restore operations, clicking this will attempt to cancel the current operation.  Please note that clicking Cancel may not have an immediate response, it can take some time before the operation reaches a point where it will be terminated.</p>
								<p>The "Cancel" button does NOT undo the operation, cancelling an operation will result in an unusable backup file or a corrupted save game when cancelling a restore operation.  The "Cancel" button is intended for emergencies only, such as an incorrect configuration causing a lengthy backup of the wrong folder.</p>

					</ul>

					<p>The Game Manager is a central hub for all important GBM functions.  However, i'd highly recommend the "Add Game Wizard" to add new games to monitor until you become familiar with GBM.</p>


					<h3>Game Configuration</h3>

					<p>The following is advanced detail on each field used to setup a game to monitor.</p>

					<h4>Name:</h4>

					<p>The name of the game to monitor. The name must conform to Windows file name standards, it will be automatically filtered for length and any bad characters.</p>

					<p>Multiple entries with the same name are allowed to handle games that run from multiple executable files (many older PC games in the 3DFX era for example).</p>

					<h4>Process:</h4>

					<p>The name of the game's executable file, without the extension. This IS case-sensitive (except in the case of dosbox.exe), if entered incorrectly the game will not be detected. Extensions will be automatically filtered off.</p>

					<p>If you don't know what to put here, check the game's "target" in the shortcut or game's folder. Beware of games that use launchers, you do NOT want to monitor the launcher, you want to detect and monitor the game itself.</p>

					<p>Multiple entries with the same process are allowed, this is to handle games that use the same name for their executable.</p>

					<p>GBM has been designed to monitor DOSBOX applications as well. The process name needs to indicate the dosbox process and the name of the DOS executable separated by a colon. Ex. dosbox:CAPPLUS</p>

					<p>It's highly recommended to use the "Add Game Wizard" to configure a DOS game if you're unsure of what you're doing.</p>

					<p>ScummVM games are also supported, but on the specific condition that each game uses it's own copy of ScummVM in a unique location. No special setup is required, you simply need to use "scummvm" as the process name.</p>

					<h4>Path:</h4>

					<p>The location of the save files for the game.</p>

					<p>Most games don't tell you where they save. I highly recommend using PC Gaming Wiki or searching common locations such as the game's installation folder, My Documents or AppData for the location of game saves.</p>

					<p>This path can be absolute, or relative to the game's executable.</p>

					<p>GBM will automatically determine absolute or relative path settings. If the save games are located in the game folder itself, you should always strive to use a path relative to the game's executable, this way your configuration will work on any PC regardless of where a game is installed. If you don't know what that means then I highly recommend using the "Add Game Wizard" to add new games.</p>

					<h4>Folder Save:</h4>

					<p>This indicates if GBM should backup the entire folder indicated in the path. If you don't really know what files are important to be saving, just tick this box.</p>

                    <h4>Time Stamp:</h4>

					<p>This indicates if you want GBM to attach a time stamp to your backup files. This allows you to have incremental backups for that application.</p>

					<h4>Include:</h4>

					<p>This indicates what file types, specific files or sub-folders should be included in the backup. This setting is ignored if Folder Save is enabled.  You can include multiple entries by separating them with a colon.</p>

					<p>An example where this setting would be used would be with an old PC game that uses save files with specific extensions inside the installation folder, such as "save.00" and "save.01".</p>

					<p>Example: *.00:*.01</p>

                    <p>Note:  Prior to v0.93 this field is named File Type and only one entry is allowed.</p>

					<h4>Exclude:</h4>

					<p>The exclude list is an advanced feature that allows you exclude specific files, folders or types of files from the backup. You can exclude multiple entries by separating them with a colon.</p>

					<p>This would be used when the save location contains other files you don't want included. An example would be Simcity 4, which includes 100 MB of example cities in the save folder.</p>

					<p>The following example excludes all that useless data from the backup file.</p>

				    <p>Example: Berlin:Downloads:Fairview:London:New York:San Francisco:Timbuktu</p>

                    <h4>Important notice regarding Include & Exclude:</h4>

                    <p>As of v0.93 you no longer need to use wildcards or trailing slashes to include or exclude sub-folders,  doing so may cause the backup to fail or not properly include or exclude the indicated folder.</p>

                    <p>As of v0.93 entries with spaces no longer need to enclosed in double quotes.</p>

				    <h3>Extra Information</h3>

					<h4>Game Path:</h4>

					<p>This is the path to the game's executable file.  In most cases GBM will auto-detect this information, but it can be set manually.</p>
					<p>The path is used to determine the save location for games with a relative save path.  It is also used to properly detect games that share process names, like ScummVM games.</p>

					<h4>Company:</h4>

					<p>You can manually set a company name to be displayed when the game is detected.  This takes priority over the company information detected from the game's executable.</p>

					<h4>Version:</h4>

					<p>You can manually set a version value to be displayed when the game is detected.  This takes priority over the version information detected from the game's executable.</p>

					<h4>Icon:</h4>

					<p>You can manually set a icon to be displayed when the game is detected.  This takes priority over the icon used by the game's executable.</p>

					<h3>Monitor Settings</h3>

					<h4>Monitor this Game:</h4>

					<p>This box indicates that GBM will actively monitor for this game.</p>

					<h4>Monitor Only (No Backup):</h4>

					<p>This box indicates that GBM will not trigger a backup when the game is closed.</p>

					<h3>Backup Information</h3>

					<h4>Current Backup:</h4>

					<p>This displays information about the most current backup file.</p>

					<h4>Local Backup:</h4>

					<p>This displays information about the last backup or restore on the current computer.</p>

					<h4>Backup Size</h4>

					<p>This displays the backup file size.</p>

			<div id="pageSection"><div id="pageSectionHeader"><a name="customvariables">Custom Path Variables</a></div>
				<div id="pageSectionContent">
					<p>This screen allows you add an unlimited number of custom path variables to use in the configuration of your games.</p>

					<p>Some applications and games store save files in common locations that can be slightly different on each computer, this feature allows you account for that and share configurations between any computer.</p>

					<p>For example, games designed for Valve's Steam service can use the Steam "userdata" folder as a common save location.</p>

					<p>The problem with this location is that Steam can be installed in many different locations on a computer, as well as every Steam user having a different ID folder, therefore every computer will save in a different location and need a unique configuration.</p>

					<p>But if we use the custom path variable feature we can create a variable for this location, such as "Steam User Data" and point it to the steam\userdata\*your id* folder.</p>

					<p>Once we do this, any application configured to use that folder will use the variable instead.</p>

					<p>Any another computer using that configuration simply has to setup the same variable and point it to the proper folder on their computer.</p>

					<p>This is an advanced feature and can be completely ignored by most users, the official pre-configured list will never contain games that use a custom path variable.</p>

				<div id="pageSectionContent">
					<h3>Tools</h3>

					<p>"Tools -> Game List -> Import Official Game List" is used to import games from the official preconfigured list. Games that already exist in the Game Manager will not be listed to import.</p>

					<p>"Tools -> Game List -> Import Game List" is used to add entries to your game list from an exported XML file.  Games that already exist in the Game Manager will not be listed to import.</p>

					<p>"Tools -> Game List -> Export Game List" is used to create an XML copy of your game list. This would be mainly used as a backup method or for sharing configurations with your friends.</p>

					<p>"Tools -> Sync Manifests" is used to clean up the local manifest of any backup information that is no longer relevant, based on the information in the current backup folder. When backup data is deleted from one computer, other computers using GBM may still be storing data about the deleted backup that is no longer useful. The only time this tool shouldn't be used is if you are alternating between backup folders, such as using a cloud folder for small backups and external drive for large backups.</p>

					<p>"Tools -> Compact Databases" is used to rebuild GBM's databases to use an optimal amount of disk space. It should only be used when databases are reaching a noticably large size.</p>

				<div id="pageSectionContent">
					<p>GBM has an optional feature that will sync all applicable game list data between computers that share the same backup folder.</p>

					<p>All computers are synced to a single master list stored in the backup folder.</p>

					<p>This allows all computers with GBM to use the same game list and session time information!</p>

					<p>Syncing is enabled by default but can be disabled if you're using GBM on a single computer.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The sync feature can be disabled from the "Settings" screen.</li>
						<li>When changing the location of your backup folder, GBM will detect if game list data exists and ask how you'd like sync it.</li>
						<li>A sync from master to local occurs when GBM is loaded, and any time GBM detects another application has changed the master list.</li>
						<li>A sync from local to the master occurs anytime the local game list is changed or when the session time for a game is updated.</li>
